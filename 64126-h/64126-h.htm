<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>The writer has heretofore produced in the vein of
fiction, after the manner of the Mühlbach interpretations,
several books which were anecdotal narratives of the crises
in the lives of public men. While they were fiction, they
largely confided to the reader what was truth and what
the conveyance of fiction for the sake of narrative form.
It was the purpose of such a book to picture by folk-lore
and local stories the early life of the man.</p>

<p>The folk-lore of a period usually interprets the man
of the period in a very atmospheric way. <a href="#i_fp154">Jonathan Trumbull</a>,
Washington’s “Brother Jonathan,” who had a part
in helping to save the American army in nearly every
crisis of the Revolutionary War, and who gave the popular
name to the nation, led a remarkable life, and came
to be held by Washington as “among the first of the patriots.”
The book is a folk-lore narrative, with a thread
of fiction, and seeks to picture a period that was decisive
in American history, and the home and neighborhood of
one of the most delightful characters that America has
ever known—the Roger de Coverley of colonial life and
American knighthood; very human, but very noble, always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
true; the fine old American gentleman—“Brother
Jonathan.”</p>

<p>It has been said that a story of the life of Jonathan
Trumbull would furnish material for pen-pictures of the
most heroic episodes of the Revolutionary War, and bring
to light much secret history of the times when Lebanon,
Conn., was in a sense the hidden capital of the political
and military councils that influenced the greatest events
of the American struggle for liberty. The view is in
part true, and a son of Governor Trumbull so felt that
force of the situation that he painted the scenes of which
he first gained a knowledge in his father’s farmhouse,
beginning the work in that plain old home on the sanded
floor.</p>

<p>From Governor Trumbull’s <a href="#i_fp060">war office</a>, which is still
standing at Lebanon, went the post-riders whose secret
messages determined some of the great events of the war.
Thence went forth recruits for the army in times of peril,
as from the forests; thence supplies for the army in
famine, thence droves of cattle, through wilderness ways.</p>

<p>Governor Trumbull was the heart of every need in
those terrible days of sacrifice.</p>

<p>His wife, Faith Trumbull, a descendant of the Pilgrim
Pastor Robinson of Leyden, was a heroic woman
to whom the Daughters of the Revolution should erect
a monument. The picture which we present of her in
the cloak of Rochambeau is historically true.</p>

<p>The eminent people who visited the secret town of the
war during the great Revolutionary events were many,
and their influence had decisive results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span></p>

<p>Look at some of the names of these visitors: Washington,
Lafayette, Samuel Adams, Putnam, Jefferson, Franklin,
Sullivan, John Jay, Count Rochambeau, Admiral
Tiernay, Duke of Lauzun, Marquis de Castellax, and the
officers of Count Rochambeau and many others.</p>

<p>The post-riders from Governor Trumbull’s plain farmhouse
on Lebanon Hill (called Lebanon from its cedars)
represented the secret service of the war.</p>

<p>When the influence of this capital among the Connecticut
hills became known, Governor Trumbull’s person
was in danger. A secret and perhaps self-appointed guard
watched the wilderness roads to his war office.</p>

<p>One of these, were he living, might interpret events
of the hidden history of the struggle for liberty in a very
dramatic way.</p>

<p>Such an interpreter for the purpose of historic fiction
we have made in Dennis O’Hay, a jolly Irishman of a
liberty-loving heart.</p>

<p>In a brief fiction for young people we can only
illustrate how interesting a larger study of this subject
of the secret service of the Revolution at this place might
be made. We shall be glad if we can so interest the young
reader in the topic as to lead him to follow it in solid historic
reading in his maturer years.</p>

<p>Dennis O’Hay, a young Irishman, and a shipwrecked
mariner, had been landed at Norwich, Conn., by a schooner
which had come into the Thames from Long Island
Sound. A lusty, hearty, clear-souled sailor was Dennis;
the sun seemed to shine through him, so open to all
people was his free and transparent nature.</p>

<p>“The top of the morning to everybody,” he used to
say, which feeling of universal brotherhood was quite in
harmony with the new country he had unexpectedly
found, but of which he had heard much at sea.</p>

<p>Dennis looked around him for some person to whom
he might go for advice in the strange country to which he
had been brought. He did not have to look far, for the
town was not large, but presently a man whose very gait
bespoke importance, came walking, or rather marching,
down the street. Dennis went up to him.</p>

<p>“An’ it is somebody in particular you must be,” said
Dennis. “You seem to me like some high officer that has
lost his regiment, cornet, horse, drum-major, and all; no,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
I beg your pardon. I mean—well, I mean that you seem
to me like one who might be more than you are; I beg
your pardon again; you look like a magistrate in these
new parts.”</p>

<p>“And who are you with your blundering honesty, my
friend? You are evidently new to these parts?”</p>

<p>“And it is an Irishman that I am.”</p>

<p>“The Lord forbid, but I am an Englishman.”</p>

<p>“Then we are half brothers.”</p>

<p>“The Lord forbid. What brings you here?”</p>

<p>“Storms, storms, and it is a shipwrecked mariner that
I am. And I am as poor as a coot, and you have ruffles,
and laces, and buckles, but you have a bit of heart.
I can see that in your face. Your blood don’t flow
through a muscle. Have you been long in these parts?”</p>

<p>“Longer than I wish to have been. This is the land
of blue-laws, as you will find.”</p>

<p>“And it is nothing that I know of the color of the
laws, whether they be blue, or red, or white. Can you
tell me of some one to whom a shipwrecked sailor could
go for a roof to shelter him, and some friendly advice?
You may be the very man?”</p>

<p>“No, no, no. I am not your man. My name is
Peters, Samuel Peters, and I am loyal to my king and my
own country, and here the people’s hearts are turning
away from both. I am one too many here. But there
is one man in these parts to whom every one in trouble
goes for advice. If a goose were to break her leg she
would go to him to set it. The very hens go and cackle
before his door. Children carry him arbutuses and white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
lady’s-slippers in the spring, and wild grapes in the fall,
and the very Indians double up <em>so</em> when they pass his
house on the way to school. His house is in the perpendicular
style of architecture, I think. Close by it is a
store where they talk Latin and Greek on the grist barrels,
and they tell such stories there as one never heard
before. He settles all the church and colony troubles,
which are many, doctors the sick, and keeps unfaculized
people, as they call the poor here, from becoming an
expense to the town. He looks solemn, and wears <em>dignified</em>
clothes, but he has a heart for everybody; the very
dogs run after him in the street, and the little Indian
children do the same. He is a kind of Solomon. What
other people don’t know, he does. But he has a suspicious
eye for me.”</p>

<p>“That is my man, sure,” said Dennis. “Children
and dogs know what is in the human heart. What may
that man’s name be? Tell me that, and you will be doing
me a favor, your Honor.”</p>

<p>“His name is Jonathan Trumbull. They call him
‘Brother Jonathan,’ because he helps everybody, hinders
nobody, and tries to make broken-up people over new.”</p>

<p>“And where does he live, your Honor?”</p>

<p>“At a place called Lebanon, there are so many
cedars there. I do not go to see him, because I did
so once, but while he smiled on every one else, he scowled
<em>this way</em> on me, as if he thought that I was not all that I
ought to be. He is a magistrate, and everybody in the
colony knows him. He marries people, and goes to the
funerals of people who go to heaven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>“That is my man. What are the blue-laws?”</p>

<p>“One of the blue-laws reads that married people
must live together or go to jail. If a man and woman
who were not married were to go to <em>him</em> to settle a dispute,
he would say to them—‘Join your right hands.’
When he rises up to speak in church, the earth stands
still, and the hour glass stops, and the sun on the dial.
But he has no use for me.”</p>

<p>“That is my man, sure,” said Dennis. “Trumbull,
Trumbull, but it was his ship on which I sailed from
Derry, and that was lost.”</p>

<p>“He has lost two ships before. It is strange that a
man whose meal-chest is open to all should be so unfortunate.
It don’t seem to accord with the laws of Providence.
I sometimes doubt that he is as good as all the
people think him to be.”</p>

<p>“But the fruits of life are not money-making, your
Honor. A man’s influence on others is the fruit of life,
and what he is and does. A man is worth just what his
soul is worth, and not less or more. He is the man that
I am after, for sure. How does one get to his house?”</p>

<p>“The open road from Norwich leads straight by his
house, all the way to Boston, through Windham County,
where lately the frogs had a great battle, and <em>millions</em> of
them were slain.”</p>

<p>Dennis opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Faix?”</p>

<p>“Faix, stranger. Yes, yes; I have just written an account
of the battle, to be published in England. After
the frogs had a battle, the caterpillars had another, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
then the hills at a place called Moodus began to rumble
and quake, and become colicky and cough. This is a
strange country.</p>

<p>“But these things,” he added, “are of little account
in comparison to the fact that the heart of the people is
turning against the laws that the good king and his minister
make for the welfare of the colony. They allow the
people here to be one with the home government by bearing
a part of the taxes. And the people’s hearts are
becoming alien. I do not wonder that frogs fight, and
caterpillars, and that the hills groan and shake and upset
milk-pans, and make the maids run they know not where.”</p>

<p>“I must seek that man they call ‘Brother Jonathan.’
Something in me says I must. That way? Well, Dennis
O’Hay will start now; it is a sorry story that I will have
to tell him, but it is a true heart I will have to take
to him.”</p>

<p>“I am going back to England,” said Mr. Peters.</p>

<p>“Well, good-by is it to you,” said Dennis, and the
young Irishman set his face toward Lebanon of the cedars,
on the road from Boston to Philadelphia by way of New
York. He stopped by the way to talk with the people
he met about the warlike times, and things happening at
Boston town.</p>

<p>His mind was filled with wonder at what he heard.
What a curious man the same Brother Jonathan might
be! Who were the Indian children? What was the
story of the battle of the frogs, and of the caterpillars;
what was the cause of the coughing mountains at Moodus;
why did Brother Jonathan, a man of such great heart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
scowl at the same Mr. Peters, and who was this same
Mr. Peters?</p>

<p>Dennis took off his hat as he went on toward Lebanon,
turning over in his mind these questions. He swung his
hat as he went along, and the blue jays peeked at him
and laughed, and the conquiddles (bobolinks) seemed to
catch the wonder in his mind, and to fly off to the hazel
coverts. Rabbits stood up in the highway, then shook
their paws and ran into the berry bushes by the brooks.</p>

<p>Everything seemed strange, as he hurried on, picking
berries when he stopped to rest.</p>

<p>At noon the sun glared; fishing hawks, or ospreys,
wheeled in the air, screaming. A bear, with her cubs,
stopped at the turn of the way. The bear stood up.
Dennis stood still.</p>

<p>The bear looked at Dennis, and Dennis at the bear.
Then the bear seemed to speak to the cubs, and she and
her family bounded into the cedars.</p>

<p>This was not Londonderry. Everything was fresh,
shining and new. At night the air was full of the wings
of birds, as the morning had been of songs of birds.</p>

<p>The sun of the long day fell at last, and the twilight
shone red behind the gray rocks, oaks and cedars.</p>

<p>Dennis sat down on the pine needles.</p>

<p>“It is a sorry tale that I will have to tell Brother
Jonathan to-morrow,” said he. “It will hurt my heart
to hurt his heart.”</p>

<p>Then the whippoorwills began to sing, and Dennis
fell asleep under the moon and stars.</p>

<p>If the reader would know more about Mr. Peters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Samuel Peters, let him consult any colonial library, and
he will find there a collection of stories of early Connecticut,
such as would tend to make one run home after
dark. The same Mr. Peters was an Episcopal clergyman,
who did not like the Connecticut main or the
“blue-laws.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Dennis came to the farming town on the hills among
the green cedars; he banged on the door of the Governor’s
house with his hard knuckles, in real Irish vigor.</p>

<p>The Governor’s wife answered the startling knock.</p>

<p>“And faith it is a shipwrecked sailor. I am from the
north of ould Ireland, it is now, and would you be after
a man of all work, or any work? There is lots of days of
work now in these two fists, lady, and that you may well
believe.” He bowed three times.</p>

<p>“The Governor is away from home,” said my lady.
“He has gone to New Haven by the sea. What is your
name?”</p>

<p>“My name is Dennis O’Hay, an honest name as ever
there was in Ireland of the north countrie, and I am an
honest man.”</p>

<p>“You look it, my good friend. You have an honest
face, but there is fire in it.”</p>

<p>“And there are times, lady, when the coals should
burn on the hearth of the heart, and flame up into one’s
cheeks and eyes. A storm is coming, lady, a land storm;
there are hawks in the air. I would serve you well,
lady. It is a true heart that you have. I can see it in
your face, lady.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“And what can you do, Dennis O’Hay? You were
bred to the sea.”</p>

<p>“And it is little that I can not do, that any man can
do with his two fists. You have brains up here among
the hills, lady, but there may come a day that you will
need fists as well as brains, and wits more than all, for I
am a peaceable man; I can work, and I could suffer or die
for such people as you all seem to be up here. The heart
of Dennis O’Hay is full of this new cause for liberty. I
could throw up my hat over the sun for that cause, lady.
I would enlist in that cause, and drag the guns to the
battle-field like a packhorse. Oh, I am full of America,
honest now, and no blarney.”</p>

<p>“I do not meddle with my husband’s affairs, but I
can not turn you away from these doors. How could I
send away any man who is willing to enlist for a cause
like ours? Dennis O’Hay, go to the tavern over there,
and ask for a meal in the name of Faith Trumbull. Then
come back here and I will give you the keys to the store
in the war office, for I can trust you with the keys, and
when my goodman comes back I will send him to
you.”</p>

<p>“Lady, this is the time to say a word to you. Ask
about me among the other sailors, if they come here, so
that you may know that I have lived an honest life.
Does not your goodman need a guard?”</p>

<p>“I had never thought of such a thing.”</p>

<p>“You are sending soldiers and food and cattle to the
camps, I hear; who knows what General Gage might be led
to do? They have secret guards in foreign parts, men of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the ‘secret service,’ as they call them. Lady, there are
things that come to one, down from the skies, or up from
the soul. It is all like the ‘pattern on the mount of
vision’ that they preach about. A voice within me has
been saying, ‘Go and work for the Governor among the
hills, and watch out for him.’ But you must test me first,
lady. I would keep <em>you</em> from harm; there is nothing
that should ever stand between these two fists of Dennis
O’Hay and such as you. But that day will come. I will go
to the tavern now, and God and all the saints bless you,
and your goodman forever, and make a great nation of
this green land of America, and keep the same Dennis
O’Hay, which I am that, in the way of his duty.”</p>

<p>The tavern, which became an historic inn, where some
of the most notable people of America and of France
were entertained during the days of the Revolution, stood
at a little distance from the Governor’s house. Dennis
O’Hay went there so elated that he tossed his sailor’s hat
into the air.</p>

<p>“It is little that I would not do for a lady like that,”
he said. “The sea tossed me here on purpose. Night,
thou mayest have my service; watch me, ye stars! Liberty,
thou mayest have my blood; call me, ye fife and
drum. Let me but get at the heart of the Governor,
and his life and home shall be secure from all harm
under the clear eye of Dennis O’Hay. Hurrah, hurrah,
hurrah! and it is here I am in America!”</p>

<p>The landlord stood in the door.</p>

<p>“And who are you, my friend?”</p>

<p>“Dennis, your Honor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>“And what brings you here?”</p>

<p>“Not the ship; for the ship went down. What brings
me here? My two legs—no——”</p>

<p>He paused, and looked reverent.</p>

<p>“The Hand Unseen. I came to enlist in the struggles
for the freedom of America. Give me a bite in the name
of the lady down the road.”</p>

<p>“My whole table is at your service, my friend. I like
your spirit. We need you here.”</p>

<p>“And here I am—how I got here I do not know, but
I <em>am</em> here, and my name is Dennis O’Hay.”</p>

<p>He waited long for the return of the Governor to the
war office, or country store, looking out of the window
over the tops of the green hills.</p>

<p>“An’ faix, I do believe,” he said at last, “I minds
me that this is the day when the world stands still. But,
O my eyes, what is it that you see now?”</p>

<p>A light form of a little one came out of the door of
the Governor’s house and walked to the war office. It
was a girl, beautiful in figure, with a sensitive face, full
of sympathy and benevolence.</p>

<p>She opened the door.</p>

<p>“My name is Faith,” said she. “I am Mr. Trumbull’s
daughter. I keep store sometimes when my father,
the Governor, is away late. I thought I would open
the store this afternoon. Customers are likely to come,
near nightfall.”</p>

<p>“I would help you tend store,” said Dennis O’Hay,
“if I only knew how. It is not handy at a bargain that
I would be now, and barter people, if you call them that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
here, would all get the best of me. But I may be able to
do such things some day.”</p>

<p>He looked out of the window, and suddenly exclaimed—“Look!”</p>

<p>A man on a noble horse was coming, flying as it
seemed, down the Lebanon road from the Windham
County hills. His horse leaped into the air at times, as
full of high spirit, and dashed up to the store.</p>

<p>Faith, the beautiful girl, went to the door.</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">The rider gasped—“Where is your father, Faith?”</a></p>

<p>“He is gone to New Haven, Mr. Putnam.”</p>

<p>“I want to see him at once; there is secret news from
Boston. But I must see him. I must not leave here
until he returns. I will go over to the tavern and wait.”</p>

<p>Dennis came out and stood in front of the store.</p>

<p>“Stranger,” said the rider, “and who are you? You
do not look like a farmer.”</p>

<p>“Who am I? I am myself, sure, a foreigner among
foreigners, Dennis O’Hay, a castaway, from the north
of Ireland.”</p>

<p>“And what brings you here?”</p>

<p>“I came to enlist,” said Dennis.</p>

<p>“You will be wanted,” said Mr. Putnam. “You
have shoulders as broad as Atlas, who carried the world
on his back.”</p>

<p>“The world on his back? What did he walk upon?”</p>

<p>“That is a question too much,” said the rider. “I’ll
leave my horse in your hands, Dennis O’Hay, and go to
the tavern and see what I can find out about the Governor’s
movements there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>He strode across the green.</p>

<p>The sun was going down, sending up red and golden
lances, as it were, over the dark shades of the cedars. On
the hills lay great farms half in glittering sunlight, half
in dark shadows.</p>

<p>“Have you any thought when the Governor will
return?” asked the rider of the tavern-keeper.</p>

<p>“No, Israel, I have not—but I hear that there is
important news from Boston—that it is suspected that
the British are about to make a move to capture the
stores of American powder at Concord. The Governor,
I mind me, knows something about the secrets of powder
hiding, but of that I can not be sure.”</p>

<p>“Great events are at hand,” said Putnam. “I can feel
them in the air. I had the same feeling before the
northern campaign. I must stay here until the Governor
arrives.”</p>

<p>“You shall have the best the tavern affords,” said
the innkeeper.</p>

<p>The sun went down blazing on the hills, seeming like
a far gate of heaven, as its semicircular splendors filled
the sky. Then came the hour of shadows with the advent
of the early stars, and then the grand procession of the
night march of the hosts of heaven that looks bright
indeed over the dark cedars.</p>

<p>The air was silent, as though the world were dead.
The taverners listened long in front of the tavern for
the sound of horses’ feet on the Lebanon road.</p>

<p>“Will the Governor come alone?” asked Dennis
O’Hay of Israel Putnam, the rider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, my sailor friend; who is there to harm him?”</p>

<p>“But there will be danger. There ought to be a guard
on the Lebanon road. Did not the Governor save the
powder, ammunition, and stores, in the northern war?
So they said at Norwich. Some day General Gage will
put a long eyes on him.”</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>The taverners went into the tavern and sat down in
the common room.</p>

<p>“I will wait until midnight before I go to my room.
My message to the Governor must be delivered as soon
as he returns.”</p>

<p>The public room was lighted with candles, and a fire
was kindled on the hearth. It was spring, but a hearth
fire had a cheerful glow even then.</p>

<p>The taverners talked of the military events around
Boston town, then told stories of adventure. Dennis came
from the store, and sat down with the rest.</p>

<p>“Mr. Putnam,” said one of them, “the story of your
hunting the she-wolf is told in all the houses of the new
towns, but we have never heard it from yourself. The
clock weights sink low, and we wish to keep awake. Tell
us about that wily wolf, and how you felt when your
eyes met hers in the cave.”</p>


<h3>THE WITCH-WOLF</h3>

<p>“I never boast of the happenings of my life,” said
Israel Putnam. “It is my nature to dash and do, and I
but give point to the plans of others. That is nothing
to boast of. Put on cedar wood and I will tell the tale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of that cunning animal, a ‘witch-wolf,’ as some call her,
as well as I can. The people at the taverns often ask
me to kill time for them in that way.</p>

<p>“I came to Pomfret in 1749. For some years I was
a busy man, toiling early and late, as you may know. I
raised a house and barn; some of you were at the raising.
I chopped down trees, made fences, planted apple-trees,
sowed and reaped.</p>

<p>“My farm grew. I had a growing herd of cattle, but
my pride was in my flock of sheep.</p>

<p>“One morning, as I went out to the hill meadows, I
found that some of my finest sheep had disappeared. I
called them, and I wandered the woods searching for
them, but they were not to be found. Then a herdman
came to me and said that he had found blood and wool in
one place, and sheep bones in another, and that he felt
sure that the missing sheep had been destroyed by powerful
wolves.</p>

<p>“In a few days other sheep were missing. Day by day
passed, and I lost in a few months a great number of
sheep.</p>

<p>“One morning I went out to the sheepfolds, and
found that some animal had killed a whole flock of sheep.</p>

<p>“‘It is a she-wolf that is the destroyer’ said a herdman,
‘a witch-wolf, it may be. Would you dare to
attack her?’</p>

<p>“My brain was fired. There lay my sheep killed
without a purpose, by some animal in which had grown
a thirst for blood.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, yes—’ said I, ‘wolf or demon, whatever it be,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
I will give my feet no rest until I hold its tongue in my
own hands, and that I will do. I have force in my head,
and iron in my hands. Call the neighbors together and
let us have a wolf hunt.’</p>

<p>“The neighbors were called together, and the conch
shell was blown. We tracked the wolf and got sight of
her. She was no witch, but a long, gaunt, powerful she-wolf,
a great frame of bones, with a sneaking head and
evil eyes.</p>

<p>“We pursued her, but she was gone. She seemed to
vanish. ‘She is a witch,’ said the herdman. ‘She is
no witch,’ said I, ‘and if she were, it is my duty to put
her out of existence, and I will!’</p>

<p>“We hunted her again and again, but she was too
cunning for us. She disappeared. She would be absent
during the summer, but in the fall she would return, and
bring her summer whelps with her. She fed her brood
not only on my flocks but on those of the farms of the
country around. We gathered new bands to hunt her;
the people rose in arms against her—against that one
cunning animal.—Put cedar wood on the fire.</p>

<p>“I formed a new plan. We would hunt her continuously,
two at a time.</p>

<p>“She lost a part of one foot in a steel trap at last.
Then the people came to know that she was no witch.
We could track her now by the mark of the three feet
in the snow. She limped, and her three sound feet could
not make the quick shifts that her four feet had made
of old.</p>

<p>“One day we set out on a continuous hunt. We followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
her from our farms away to the Connecticut River.
Then the three-footed animal came back again, and we
followed her back to the farms.</p>

<p>“But the bloodhounds now knew her and had got
scent of her, and they led us to a den in the woods. This
den was only about three miles from my house. She may
have hidden in it many times before.</p>

<p>“We gathered before the den, and lighted straw and
pushed it into the den to drive her out. But she did not
appear.</p>

<p>“Then we put sulphur on the straw and forced it
into the den, so that it might fill the cavern with the
fumes. But the three-footed wolf did not come out of
the den. The cave might be a large one; it might have
an opening out some other way.</p>

<p>“We called a huge dog, and bade him to enter the
cave. He dove down through the opening. Presently
we heard him cry; he soon backed out of the opening,
bleeding. The wolf was in the cave.</p>

<p>“Another dog, and another were forced to enter the
cave, both returning whining and bleeding. Neither
smoke nor dogs were able to destroy that animal that had
made herself a terror of the country round.</p>

<p>“I called my negro herder.</p>

<p>“‘Sam,’ said I, ‘you go into the cave and end that
animal.’</p>

<p>“‘Not for a thousand pounds, nor for all the sheep
on the hills of the Lord. What would become of Sam?
Look at the dogs’ noses. Would you send me where no
dog could go?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>“‘Then I shall go myself,’ said I, for nothing can
stop me from anything when my resolution has gathered
force; there are times when I must lighten.</p>

<p>“I took off my coat and prepared to go down into the
cave. My neighbors held me back. I took a torch, and
plunged down the entrance to the cave, head first, with
the torch blazing.</p>

<p>“Had I made the effort with a gun, the wolf might
have rushed at me, but she crouched and sidled back
before the fire.</p>

<p>“The entrance was slippery, but my will forced
me on.</p>

<p>“I could rise up at last. The cave was silent; the
darkness might be felt. I doubt that any human being
had ever entered the place before.</p>

<p>“I walked slowly, then turning aside my torch, peered
into the thick darkness.</p>

<p>“Two fierce eyes, like balls of fire, confronted me.
The she-wolf was there, waiting for some advantage, but
cowed by the torch.</p>

<p>“Presently I heard a growl and a gnashing of
teeth.</p>

<p>“I had drawn into the cave a rope tied around my
body, so that I might be drawn out by my neighbors if
I should need help. I gave the signal to pull me out.
I understood the situation.</p>

<p>“I was drawn up in such a way that my upper clothing
was pulled over my body, and my flesh was torn. I
grasped my gun and crawled back again.—Put more
cedar wood on the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“I saw the eyes of the wolf again. I heard her snap
and growl. I leveled my gun.</p>

<p>“<em>Bang!</em> The noise seemed to deafen me. The smoke
filled the cave.</p>

<p>“I gave a signal to my neighbors to draw me out. I
listened at the mouth of the cave. All was silent. The
smoke must have found vent. I went into the cave
again.</p>

<p>“It was silent.</p>

<p>“I found the body of the wolf. It was stiff and was
growing cold. I took hold of her ears and gave a signal
to those outside to draw me out.</p>

<p>“As I was drawn from the mouth of the cave I
dragged the wolf after me.</p>

<p>“Then my friends set up a great shout. My eyes
had met those of the she-wolf but once, then there was
living fire in them, terrible but pitiful. Hark—what is
that?”</p>

<p>There was a sound of horses’ feet.</p>

<p>“The Governor is coming,” said one of the taverners.</p>

<p>Israel Putnam ran out to meet him, and spoke to him
a few words.</p>

<p>“Let us go to the war office at once, and shut the
door and be by ourselves,” said the Governor.</p>

<p>They hurried to the war office, and the Governor shut
the door, not to open it again until morning.</p>

<p>Dennis O’Hay went back to the tavern, and wondered
and wondered.</p>

<p>“Faix, and this is a quare country, and no mistake,”
said he. What would the Governor say to him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>Would he be the first to tell him that the ship had
gone down?</p>

<p>He talked with taverners about the subject.</p>

<p>“I must break the news, gently like,” he said. “I
would hate to hurt his heart.”</p>

<p>“He has lost ships before,” said one.</p>

<p>“His losses have made him a poor man,” said another.
“But he marches right on in the way of duty, as though
he owned the stars.”</p>

<p>Dennis fell asleep on the settle, wondering, and he
must have dreamed wonderful dreams.</p>

<small>THE JOLLY FARMER OF WINDHAM HILLS AND HIS FLOCK
OF SHEEP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was an old manor in sunny England to which
Lord Cornwallis used to resort, and a certain Captain
Blackwell purchased a territory in Windham, Conn.,
among the green hills and called it Mortlake Manor, after
the English demesne. Here Israel Putnam purchased a
farm of some 500 acres, at what is now Pomfret, Conn.,
and began to raise great herds of cattle and flocks of
sheep, and to plant apple-trees.</p>

<p>He was made a major in the northern campaign, afterward
a colonel, then in the Indian War he became a
general. They called him “Major Putnam,” for the title
befitted his character, and he wished to be sparing of
titles among the farmers of Windham.</p>

<p>Israel Putnam was born a hero. He had in him the
spirit of a Hannibal. He had character as well as daring;
his soul rose above everything, and he never feared
a face of day.</p>

<p>He had the soul of Cincinnatus, and not of a Cæsar.
He could leave the plow, and return to it again.</p>

<p>His conduct in the northern campaign had shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the unselfish character of his heroism. A jolly farmer
was he, and as thrifty as he was jolly. He could strike
hard blows for justice and liberty, and like a truly brave
man he could forgive his enemies and help them to rise
in a right spirit again.</p>

<p>Why had he come here at this time?</p>

<p>Let us go into the store, or, as it was beginning to
be called, the “war office,” with these two men of destiny.</p>

<p>“Governor Trumbull,” he said, “I am about to go to
Boston, and I want your approval. Boston is being
ruined by British oppression. She is almost famine-stricken,
and why? Because her people are true to their
rights.</p>

<p>“Governor, I can not sleep. Think of the situation.
Here I am on my farm, with hundreds of sheep around
me, and the men of liberty of Boston town are sitting
down to half-empty tables. Some of my sheep must be
driven away.</p>

<p>“They must be started on their way to Worcester,
and to Newtowne, and to Boston, and, Governor, the flock
must <em>grow</em> by the way.</p>

<p>“I am going to ask the farmers to swell the number
of the flock as I start with my own. Boston Common is
a British military post now—but I am going to Boston
Common with my sheep, and my flock will grow as I go,
and I will appear there at the head of a company of sheep,
and if the British Government does not lift its hand from
Boston town, I will go there with a company of soldiers.
Have I your contentment in the matter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, go, hero of Lake George and of Ticonderoga,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
go with your sheep and your flock, increase it as it goes;
but as for that other matter you suggest, let us talk of
that, the matter of what is to be done if British oppression
is to increase.”</p>

<p>They talked all night, and Putnam said that the liberties
of the colonies were more than life to him, and that
he stood ready for any duty. He rode away in the light
of the morning.</p>

<p>As he passed the tavern, Dennis O’Hay went to the
war office, where the Connecticut militia used to appear,
to meet the Governor.</p>

<p>“The top of the morning to you, Governor,” said
Dennis, holding his cap in his hand above his head.</p>

<p>“My good friend, I do not know you,” said the
Governor, “but that you are here for some good purpose,
I can not doubt. What is your business with me?”</p>

<p>“I was a sailor, sir, and our ship went down, sir, but
I came up, sir, and am still on the top of the earth. I
am an Irishman, sir, from Ireland of the North, that
breeds the loikliest men on the other side of the world, sir,
among which, please your Honor, I am one.</p>

<p>“I have heard about the stamp act, sir. England
has taxed Ireland into the earth, sir. We live in hovels,
sir, that the English may dwell in castles, sir. I wouldn’t
be taxed, sir, were I an American without any voice in
the government, sir. That would be nothing but slavery.</p>

<p>“I would like to enlist, sir. I have heard of the
minutemen, sir, and it is a half-a-minute man that I
would like to become.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see, my good fellow; I read the truth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
what you say in your looks. Let me go to my breakfast,
and I will talk over your case with my wife, Faith, and
my daughters, and my son John. In the meantime, go
and get your breakfast in the tavern.”</p>

<p>“The top of this earth and all the planets to you, sir.”</p>

<p>After breakfast the Governor summoned Dennis to
the store, which came to be called the “war office.” The
back room in the store was the council room.</p>

<p>“Did you notice that man who rode away in the
morning?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure, I did, sir. I heard him tell a story last night
in the tavern. The flesh was gone from one of his
hands.”</p>

<p>“It was torn from his hand while pouring water on
a fire which was burning the barracks near a magazine
which contained 300 barrels of powder. That was in the
north.”</p>

<p>“Did he save the magazine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my good friend. He is a brave man, and he is
soon going with a drove of sheep to Boston.</p>

<p>“You ask for work,” continued the Governor. “I
want you to go with that man, Major, Colonel, General
Putnam, and his drove of sheep to Boston, and to keep
your eye out on the way, so, if needed, you might go
over it again. I wish to train a few men to learn a
swift way to Boston town. You may be one of them.
I will have a horse saddled for you at once; follow that
man to Pomfret, to the manor farm at Windham. I will
write you a note to him, a secret note, which you must not
open by the way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“Never you fear, Governor; I couldn’t read it if I
did, but I can read life if I can not read messages.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was in the saddle, with his face
turned toward the Windham hills.</p>

<p>He found General Putnam, the “Major,” on his farm.</p>

<p>“It is the top of the morning that I said to the Governor
this morning, and it is the top of the evening that
I say to you now. I am Dennis O’Hay, from the north
of Ireland, and it is this message—which may ask that I
be relieved of my head for aught I know—that the Governor
he asked me to put into your hand. He wants me
to learn all the way to Boston town, so that I may be
able to drive cattle there, it may be. I am ready to do
anything to make this country the land of liberty. After
all that ould Ireland has suffered, I want to see America
free and glorious—and hurrah, free! That word comes
out of my heart; I don’t know why I say it. It rises up
from my very soul.”</p>

<p>“You shall learn all the way to Boston town,” said
the Major, “and I hope I shall not find you faithless, or
give you over to the British to be dealt with according
to the law.”</p>

<p>Putnam was preparing to leave for his long journey
on the new Boston road. His neighbors gathered around
him, and young farmers brought to him fine sheep, to
add to those he had gathered for the suffering patriots
of Boston town.</p>

<p>The driver of this flock knew the way, the post-houses,
the inns, the ordinaries, and the Major assigned
Dennis to him as an assistant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Putnam was a lusty man at this time, in middle life.
He wore homespun made from his own flocks. His great
farm among the hills had been developed until it was
made sufficient to support a large family and many work-people.
He raised his own beef, pork, corn, grain, apples
and fruit, and poultry. His family made their own butter
and cheese; his wife wove the clothing for all; spun
her own yarn. The manor farm might have been isolated
for a hundred years, and yet thrift would have
gone on.</p>

<p>No one was ever more self-supporting than the old-time
thrifty New England farmer. His farm was more
independent than a baron’s castle in feudal days.</p>

<p>He “put off” his butter, cheese and eggs, or bartered
them for “West India goods”; but even in these things
he might have been independent, for his maple-trees might
have yielded him sugar, and roasted crusts and nuts a
nutritious substitute for coffee and tea.</p>

<p>Putnam drove away his sheep, stopping at post-houses
by the way, and telling some merry and some thrilling
stories there of the wild campaign of the north, and of
his escapes from the Indians under Pontiac.</p>

<p>He arrived at Boston and was welcomed by the patriot
Warren.</p>

<p>A British officer faced him.</p>

<p>“And you have come down here,” said the British
officer, “to contend against England’s arm with a lot of
sheep. If you rebels do not cease your opposition, do
you want to know what will happen?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“Twenty ships of the line and twenty regiments will
be landed at the port of Boston.”</p>

<p>“If that day comes, I shall return to Boston, and I
shall bring with me men as well as sheep.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” laughed the British officer. “That is
your thought, is it, hey? It is treason, sir; treason to the
British Crown.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Putnam, “an enemy to justice is my
enemy; is every man’s enemy. It is a man’s duty to
stand by human rights.”</p>

<p>Dennis studied every farmhouse and nook and corner
by the way. He had a quick mind and a responsive heart,
and he was learning America readily.</p>

<p>He could read lettered words, so he looked well at the
sign-boards at four corners and on taverns and milestones.
He “stumbled” in book reading, but could
define signs.</p>

<p>“Could you find your way back again?” asked the
Major of him, as they rested beneath the great trees on
Boston Common.</p>

<p>“And sure it is, Major. I would find my way back
there if I had been landed at the back door of the world.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Major, “then you may go back in
advance of us alone.”</p>

<p>Dennis parted from the Major, and dismounted in a
couple of days or more before the Governor’s war office
with</p>

<p>“And it is the top of the morning, it is, Governor.”</p>

<p>“Did you bring a recommendation from the Major?”
asked the Governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“No, no, he sent me on ahead, but I can give a good
report of him.”</p>

<p>“That is the same as though he brought a good report
of you. A man who speaks well of his master is generally
to be trusted.</p>

<p>“Well, you know the way to Boston town. I think
that I can now make you useful to me, and to the cause.
We will see.”</p>

<p>Dennis found work at the tavern. He would sit on
the tavern steps to watch for the Governor in the evenings
when the latter appeared on the green. He soon joined
the good people in calling the Governor “Brother Jonathan.”</p>

<p>Dennis was superstitious—most Irishmen are—but he
was hardly more given to ghostly fears than the Connecticut
farmers were. Nearly every farmstead at that
period had its ghost story. Good Governor Trumbull
would hardly have given an hour to the fairy tale, but
he probably would have listened intently to a graveyard
or “witch” story.</p>

<p>People did not see angels then as in old Hebrew days,
but thought that there were sheeted ghosts that came out
of graveyards, or made night journeys through lonely
woods, and stood at the head of garret stairs, “avenging”
spirits that haunted those who had done them
wrong.</p>

<p>So we only picture real life when we bring Dennis
into this weird atmosphere, that made legs nimble, and
cats run home when the clouds scudded over the moon.</p>

<p>Dennis had heard ghost story after ghost story on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
journey and at the store. Almost everybody had at least
one such story to tell; how that Moodus hills would shake
and quake at times, and tip over milk-pans, and cause the
maid to hide and the dog to howl; how the timbers
brought together to build a church, one night set to capering
and dancing; how a woman who had a disease that
“unjinted her jints” (unjointed her joints) came all
together again during a great “revival”; how witches
took the form of birds, and were shot with silver bullets;
and like fantastic things which might have filled volumes.</p>

<p>“I never fear the face of day,” said Dennis, “but
apparitions! Oh, for my soul’s sake, deliver me from
them! I am no ghost-hunter—I never want to face
anything that I can’t shoot, and on this side of the water
the woods are full of people that won’t sleep in their
graves when you lay them there. I shut my eyes. Yes,
when I see anything that I can’t account for, I shut my
eyes.”</p>

<p>That was the cause of the spread of superstition.
People like Dennis “shut their eyes.” Did they meet a
white rabbit in the bush, they did not investigate—they
ran.</p>

<p>Dennis would have faced a band of spies like a giant,
but would have run from the shaking of a bush by a
mouse or ground squirrel in a graveyard.</p>

<p>He once saw a sight that, to use the old term, “broke
him up.” He was passing by a family graveyard when
he thought that an awful apparition that reached from
the earth to the heavens rose before him.</p>

<p>“Oh, and it was orful!” said he. “It riz right up out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of the graves into the air, with its <em>paws</em> in the moon. It
was a white horse, and he <em>whickered</em>. My soul went out
of me; I hardly had strength enough in my legs to get
back to the green; and when I did, I fell flat down on my
face, and all America would never tempt me to go that
way again.”</p>

<p>The white horse whose “paws” were in the moon was
only an animal turned out into the highway to pasture,
that lifted himself up on the stout bough of a graveyard
wild apple-tree to eat apples from the higher limbs.
Horses were fond of apples, and would sometimes lift
themselves up to gather them in this way.</p>

<p>The ghost story was the favorite theme at the store
on long winter evenings.</p>

<p>“If one could be sure that they met an evil ghost,
one would know that there must be good spirits that had
gone farther on,” reasoned the men.</p>

<p>“They may as well all go farther on,” said Dennis.
“Such things do not haunt good people.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<small>THE FIRST OF PATRIOTS AT HOME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A noble private school first made Lebanon of the
cedars famous. It had been founded by the prosperous
hill farmers under the influence of the Governor. To
this school the latter sent his five children, who prepared
there for college or the higher schools.</p>

<p>The Governor possessed a strong mind, that was so
clear and full of imagination as to be almost poetic and
prophetic.</p>

<p>The Scriptures were his book of poems, and he read
many books—<em>Job</em> in Hebrew, and <em>John</em> in Greek.</p>

<p>At home among his five children, all of whom were
destined to be notable, and two of them famous, he was
an ideal father. His one thought was to educate his
children for usefulness.</p>

<p>One of his sons was named John, born in 1756. Nearly
all of my readers have seen his work, for it was his gift to
paint the dramatic scenes of the Revolutionary War, and
these great historical paintings adorn not only the rotunda
of the Capitol at Washington, but several of them most
public halls, and tens of thousands of patriotic homes in
the country, especially The Battle of Bunker Hill, The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Signers of the Declaration of Independence, The Death
of Wolf, The Surrender of Cornwallis, and Washington’s
Farewell to his Army.</p>

<p>The home of the Governor may have been matted,
but was not carpeted. It was the custom at that time
to strew white sand over floors and to “herring-bone”
spare rooms. Of this sand we have a curious story.</p>

<p>Two of the daughters, Faith and Mary, were born to
a love of art. They were sent to school in Boston after
graduating at the Lebanon school, and there Faith began
to admire portraits painted in oil.</p>

<p>She studied painting in oil, and she returned to her
plain and simple home. She hung upon the walls two
portraits painted by her own hand that were a local
wonder.</p>

<p>The Governor looked upon his gifted daughter’s work
with commendable pride.</p>

<p>“You have done well, Faith. I did not expect such
gifts of you. To detain age, in keeping the face at the
age in which it is painted, is indeed a noble art. It is
worthy of you, Faith.”</p>

<p>At this time John Trumbull was a little boy. He had
been housed and nursed tenderly by his mother, because
he had a misformed head which had to be shaped out of
a defect by pressure.</p>

<p>This boy turned his face to his sister Faith’s paintings
with surprise, as they transformed the walls of the room.</p>

<p>“I want to paint, too,” said he.</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the Governor, “painting is not for
boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>He asked his sister for oils.</p>

<p>“You are too young,” thought the artistic Faith, who
was a loving, noble sister.</p>

<p>“But I must, I must.”</p>

<p>One day his mother entered the sanded room. The
white sand had been disturbed. It was lying about in
curious angles. She stopped; the sand had formed a
picture. Whose picture—probably it was intended for
herself.</p>

<p>The boy’s face met hers, possibly at an opposite door.</p>

<p>“My son, what have you been doing with the sand?”</p>

<p>“Painting, mother.”</p>

<p>“But what led you to paint in that way?”</p>

<p>“Faith’s pictures on the wall. I had to paint. I
must. I will be a painter if I grow up. The things
that father does will not live unless they are painted.
Pictures make the past <em>now</em>—they hold the past; they
make it live.”</p>

<p>“My little boy sees the value of the art like a philosopher.
You and Faith have a gift that I little expected.
I have nursed that little head of yours many
an hour; there may be pictures in it—who knows?”</p>

<p>“But father thinks that painting is girlish. How can
I get him to let me paint?”</p>

<p>“You may be able to paint so well, that he will be
proud of your art.”</p>

<p>The next day the sand took new form; another picture
filled the floor, and so day by day new pictures came to
delight the good mother’s heart.</p>

<p>The Governor saw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“There is a gift in them,” said he. “It is all right
for a little shaver like him. Boys will have to wield
something stronger than the brush in the new age that is
upon us. But we must not crush any gift of God.”</p>

<p>He turned away.</p>

<p>His family loved to be near him, and he told them
wonderful tales from the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>

<p>Queer tales of early times in the colonies he related
to them, too; stories that tended to correct false views
of life and character. Suppose we spend an hour with
the good Governor in his own home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was early evening; snow was falling on the green
boughs of the cedars of Lebanon. A great fireplace
blazed before the sitting-room table, on which were the
Bible and books.</p>

<p>On one side of the fireplace hung quartered apples
drying; on the other a rennet and red peppers, and on
the mantelpiece were shells from the Indies, candlesticks,
and pewter dishes.</p>

<p>The room became silent. The Governor’s thoughts
were far away, planning, planning, almost always planning.</p>

<p>The stillness became lonesome. Then little John, the
painter in the sand, ventured to ask his mother for a story,
and she said:</p>

<p>“I am narrowing now in my knitting; ask your
father, he is wool-gathering; call him home.”</p>

<p>Little John touched his father on the arm.</p>

<p>“It is a story that you would have,” said the Governor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
“I am thinking all by myself on a case that comes
up before me to-morrow, of a young man who has broken
the law, but did not know that there was any such law
to break. He had just come in from sea.</p>

<p>“Now, what would you do in such a case as that,
Johnny? I am thinking how to be merciful to the man
and just to others.”</p>

<p>“I would do what mother would do—mother, what
would you do in a case like that?”</p>

<p>“I do not know; there may be things to be considered.
I would follow my heart; if it would not endanger
others.”</p>

<p>“Father, what will you do? Animals break laws
about which they do not know. I pity them.”</p>

<p>“Well said, John,” said the Governor.</p>

<p>He added, beating on the back of his chair:</p>

<p>“I may have to follow my heart; but I will tell you
a story of an old Connecticut judge who followed his
heart, and something unexpected happened.”</p>

<p>The Governor dropped his stately tone, and used the
language of home. That was a charm, the home tone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It was at the time of the blue-laws,” he said.
“Those laws in one part of the State were so strict as to
forbid the making of mince pies at Christmas-time.</p>

<p>“One of these laws forbid a man to kiss his wife in
public on Sunday.”</p>

<p>The Governor seldom used story-book language. He
was going to do so now, and it would make the very fire
seem friendly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“Wandering Rufus was a merry lad. He married a
young wife, a very handsome girl, and he loved her.
Soon after his marriage he went to sea, and it was after
he went to sea that the law was enacted against the Sunday
kissing. The lawmakers little thought of the men
at sea.</p>

<p>“His wife looked out for him to come back, as a good
wife should. She pressed her nose against the pane.
She dreamed and dreamed of how happy she should be
when he should come leaping up from the wharf to
greet her.</p>

<p>“Three years passed, for he was a whaler as well as
a sailor.</p>

<p>“Three years!</p>

<p>“One day there was heard a boom at sea—boom off
New Haven. The ship was coming in, and it was
Sunday.</p>

<p>“The young wife dressed herself in her best gown,
and she never looked so pretty before. Her cheeks glowed
like roses in dew-time.</p>

<p>“She hurried down toward the wharf to meet him,
just as the bells were ringing and the people were all
going to meeting.</p>

<p>“He came up the highway to greet her, leaping—not
a becoming thing, I will allow. And he rushed into her
arms, and gave her smack after smack, and her bonnet
fell off, and the people stopped and wondered. The magistrate
wondered, too.</p>

<p>“There was a man in the seaport who was like Mr.
Legality in the Pilgrim’s Progress. The next day he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the young sailor arrested for unbecoming conduct on the
street on Sunday, and I mind me that his conduct was
not altogether becoming.</p>

<p>“The judge came into court, and read the law, and
asked:</p>

<p>“‘Rufus, my sailor boy, what have you to plead?’</p>

<p>“‘I did not know that there was any such law, your
Honor; else I would have obeyed it.’</p>

<p>“You may see that he had a true heart, like a robin
on a cherry bough.</p>

<p>“‘I must condemn you to have thirty lashes at the
whipping-post,’ said the judge—‘No, twenty lashes—no,
considering all the points of the case, ten; or five will do.
Five lashes at the whipping-post. This is the lightest
sentence that I ever imposed. But <em>he</em> did not know the
law; and he was a married man, and he had not seen his
wife for nearly three years; I must be merciful in this
particular case, and I will not say in this same case how
hard the lashes shall be laid on.’</p>

<p>“So the young sailor was whipped, and Mr. Legality
said that five lashes would not have scampered a cat.</p>

<p>“Rufus, the wanderer, prepared to go whaling again.</p>

<p>“Now, the captain of the ship had caused a chalk-mark
to be drawn across the deck of the ship, and had
made a ship law that if any one but an officer of the ship
should cross the mark, the person violating the law should
be whipped with a cat-o’-nine-tails.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say that our young sailor should have
had a revengeful spirit, but he seems to have shown a
disposition not altogether benevolent. He invited Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Legality to go on board the ship with him, just as the ship
was about to sail. Mr. Legality to atone for his want of
charity went, and he had hardly got on board before he
stepped over the chalk-line.</p>

<p>“‘Halt, halt!’ said Rufus. ‘We have a law that if
any one steps over the chalk-line he must be whipped.’</p>

<p>“‘But I did not know that there was any such a law,’
said Mr. Legality.</p>

<p>“‘But it is the law,’ said Wandering Rufus.</p>

<p>“‘But how could I have known?’ asked Mr. Legality.</p>

<p>“‘How could I have known that there was a law that
a man must not kiss his wife on the street on Sunday?’
asked Rufus.</p>

<p>“‘I see, I see; but don’t let me be whipped with the
cat-o’-nine-tails.’</p>

<p>“‘That I will not, for I am a hearty sailor. If any
one is whipped it shall be me. I wanted to show you
how the human heart feels.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Legality left the ship as fast as his legs would
carry him, and somehow that story sometimes rises before
me like a parable. I think I shall follow my heart with
this new case that comes off to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Do, do,” said the children, all five; and the mother,
lovely Faith Trumbull, said, “Yes, Jonathan, do.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said the Governor, “let us read together
the most beautiful chapter, as I mind, in all the
Epistles.”</p>

<p>The snow fell gently without; the fire cracked, and
they read together the chapter containing “Charity suffereth
long, and is kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“Beareth all things, endureth all things,” read little
John. Then tears filled his eyes, and he said:</p>

<p>“Father, I love you.”</p>

<p>But there was another side to the love and loyalty
of this sheltered town in the cedars. There were Tories
here, and they did not like the patriarchal Governor. You
must meet some of them, if it does change the atmosphere
of the narrative.</p>

<p>It has been said that no dispute could ever stand
before Brother Jonathan; it would melt away like snow
on an April day when he lifted his benignant eyes and
put the finger of one hand on the other, and said, “Let
me make it clear to you.”</p>

<p>Queer old Samuel Peters, the Episcopal agent, or
missionary in the colony, made so much fun of the good
people in his History of Connecticut, and so led England
and America to laugh by his marvelous anecdotes and
description of the blue-laws, that the really thrifty and
heroic character of these people has been misjudged.</p>

<p>A wonderful family had Brother Jonathan. His
children who lived to become of age became famous,
and they were all remarkable as children. Jonathan
Trumbull, Jr., could read Virgil at five, and had read
Homer at twelve, and could talk with his father in Latin
and Greek, and discuss Horace and Juvenal when a boy.
He, as we have said, became a great painter, and commenced
by drawing pictures in the sand which was
sprinkled on his father’s floor. They used “herring-bone”
to tidy rooms in those days, spare rooms, by dusting clean
sand on the floor, in a wavy way, leaving the floor in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the angles of a herring-bone. We do not know that it
was in such herring-boning sand that young Trumbull began
to draw pictures, but it may have been so.</p>

<p>We have visited the rooms in the old perpendicular
house where he began to draw. His good father did not
approve of his purpose to become a painter, but he
thought that genius should be allowed to follow its own
course. A man is never contented or satisfied outside
of his natural gifts and haunting inclinations. So the
battles into which his father’s spirit entered, John made
immortal by painting, and his work may be seen not only
in the rotunda of the Capitol at Washington, but in the
“Trumbull Collection” at Yale College.</p>

<p>Young Trumbull was led to continue to paint by his
sisters Faith and Mary, who went to Boston to school.
This was the Copley age of art in Boston. You may see
Copley’s pictures at the Art Museum, Boston, and among
them the almost living portrait of Samuel Adams. When
these girls returned from visits to Boston, Mary began to
paint inspiring pictures and to adorn the rooms with them.</p>

<p>She and her brother studied the lives and works of the
old masters. How? We do not know, but genius makes
a way.</p>

<p>A thrifty farmer and merchant was Col. Jonathan
Trumbull in his young days. You laugh at these old-fashioned
men, but look at what this man, who could discuss
Homer and Horace with his boys, and the arts of
Greece with his girls, accomplished through the good judgment
and private thrift in his early life. Says his principal
biographer, G. W. Stuart, of the fine young farmer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
who had ships on the sea, and was beginning to turn from
a farmer to a notable merchant:</p>

<p>“So the first years of Trumbull’s life as a merchant
passed in successful commerce abroad, in profitable trade
at home, and with high reputation in all his contacts,
negotiations, and adventures. And ‘his corn and riches
did increase.’ A house and home-estate worth over four
thousand pounds; furniture, and a library, worth six
hundred pounds; a valuable store adjacent to the dwelling;
a store, wharf, and land at East Haddam; a lot and
warehouse at Chelsea in Norwich; a valuable grist-mill
near his family seat at Lebanon; ‘a large, convenient
malt-house;’ several productive farms in his neighborhood,
carefully tilled, and beautifully spotted with rich
acres of woodland; extensive ownership, too, in the ‘Five-mile
Propriety,’ as it was called, in Lebanon, in whose
management as committeeman, and representative at
courts, and moderator at meetings of owners, Trumbull
had much to do; a stock of domestic animals worth a
hundred and thirty pounds—these possessions, together
with a well-secured indebtedness to himself, in bonds, and
notes, and mortgages, resulting from his mercantile transactions,
of about eight thousand pounds, rewarded, at the
close of the year 1763, the toil of Trumbull in the field
of trade and commerce. In all it was a property of not
less than eighteen thousand pounds—truly a large one for
the day—but one destined, by reverses in trade which the
times subsequently rendered inevitable, and by the patriotic
generosity of its owner during the great Revolutionary
struggle, to slip, in large part, from his grasp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Here is a picture of thrifty life in a country village
estate in old New England days.</p>

<p>He preached at first, then became a judge, and he
“doctored.”</p>

<p>They were queer people who doctored then, with wig
and gig. Brother Jonathan doctored the poor. He doctored
out of his goodly instincts more than from a medical
code, though he could administer prescriptions from
Latin that it was deemed presumptuous for the patient
to inquire about. Now people know what medicine they
take, but it was deemed audacious then to ask any questions
about Latin prescriptions, or to seek to penetrate
such an awful mystery as was contained in the “Ferrocesquicianurit
of the Cynide of Potassium,” or to find
out that a ranunculus bulbosus was only a buttercup.</p>

<p>Among the good old tavern tales of such old-time
doctors was one of a notional old woman, who used to
send for the doctor as often as she saw any one passing
who was going the doctor’s way. Once when there was
coming on one of these awful March snow-storms that
buried up houses, she saw a teamster hurrying against the
pitiless snow toward the town where the doctor’s office was.</p>

<p>“Hay, hay!” said she to the half-blinded man.
“Whoa, stop! Send the doctor to me—it is going to be
a desperate case.”</p>

<p>The doctor came to visit his patient, and found her
getting a bountiful meal.</p>

<p>“The dragon!” said he. “Hobgoblins and thunder,
what did you make me come out here for in all this dreadful
storm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, pardon, doctor,” said she, “it was such a good
chance to send.”</p>

<p>In ill temper, the country doctor faced the storm
again.</p>

<p>There was both an academy and an Indian school in
the town, and all the children loved Brother Jonathan.</p>

<p>The children of Boston used to follow Sam Adams in
the street in the latter’s benign old age, and the white
children and red tumbled over their dogs to meet Brother
Jonathan, when he appeared in his three-cornered hat,
ruffles and knee-breeches, and all, in the snug village
green around which the orioles sung in the great trees.</p>

<p>He had some kind word for them all. When his face
lighted up, all was happiness.</p>

<p>Among his neighbors was William Williams, a signer
of the Declaration of Independence, and a man of beautiful
soul.</p>

<p>The old church gleamed in air over the green. On
the country roads they held meetings in smaller churches
and in schoolhouses.</p>

<p>A queer story is told of one of these churches at the
time of foot-stoves; how a good woman took a foot-stove
to church and hid it under her cloak. The stove smoked,
and the warm smoke rose up under her cloak, which was
spread around her like a tent, and caused her to go to
sleep. As she bent over the smoke came out of her cloak
at the back of her neck and ascended into the sunlight of
a window. Now smoke is likely to form a circle as it
ascends, and the good people, who did not know of the
foot-stove, thought that they saw a crown of glory hanging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
over her head, and that a miracle was being performed.</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan and his good wife and children
were always in their pew on Sunday. Probably there
was a sounding-board in the primitive church and an hour-glass.
Possibly, a tithing man went about with a feather
to tickle sleepy old women on the nose, who lost consciousness
between the 7thlys and the 10thlys, and so
made them jump and say, “O Lud, massy sakes alive!”
or something equally surprising and improper.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>“OUT YOU GO”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Old Peter Wetmore, of Lebanon, was suspected of
being a Tory, but he kept shut lips. “Don’t open the doors
of your soul,” he used to say, “and people will never know
who you are. They can’t imprison your soul without the
body, nor the body unless the soul opens its gates,” by
which he meant the lips. “What I say is nothing to
nobody. I chop wood!”</p>

<p>Morose, silent, grunting, if he spoke at all, he lived
in a mossy, gable-roofed house, with a huge woodpile
before his door.</p>

<p>There was a great oak forest on rising ground above
him. Below him was a cedar swamp, with a village of
crows and crow-blackbirds, which all shouted in the morning,
and told each other that the sun was rising.</p>

<p>He was in his heart true to the King. When the
patriots of Lebanon came to him to talk politics after
the Lexington alarm, he simply said, “I chop wood.”</p>

<p>Chop wood he did. His woodpile in front of his house
was almost as high as his house itself. But he chopped
on, and all through the winter his ax flew. And he split
wood, hickory wood, with a warlike expression on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
face, as his ax came down. He had one relative—a
nephew, Peter, whom he taught to “fly around” and to
“pick up his heels” in such a nervous way that people
ceased to call him Peter Wetmore, but named him Peter
<em>Nimble</em>. The boy was so abused by his uncle that he
wore a scared look.</p>

<p>Lebanon was becoming one of the most patriotic towns
in America. At one time during the Revolutionary War
there were five hundred men in the public services. The
people were intolerant of a Tory, and old Peter Wetmore,
who chopped wood, was a suspect.</p>

<p>A different heart had young Peter, the orphan boy,
who was for a time compelled to live with him or to
become roofless.</p>

<p>The Lexington alarm thrilled him, as he heard the
news on Lebanon green.</p>

<p>He caught the spirit of the people, and as for Governor
Trumbull, he thought he was the “Lord” or almost
a divinity. The Governor probably used to give him
rides when he met him in the way. The Governor did
not “whip behind.”</p>

<p>When Peter had heard the news of the Lexington
alarm, he said:</p>

<p>“I must fly home now and tell uncle that.”</p>

<p>It was a long way from the green to the cabin that
Peter called “home.”</p>

<p>He hurried home and lifted the latch, and met his
uncle, who was scowling.</p>

<p>“What has happened now?” said the latter, seeing
Peter had been running.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“A shot has been fired on the green.”</p>

<p>“What, on Lebanon green?” gasped the old man in
alarm.</p>

<p>“No, on Lexington green.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. Lexington green is so far off.
Who fired the shot? The regulars,” he added.</p>

<p>“The young men at Lebanon are all enlisting. I
wish I were old enough to go!”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“To fight the British.”</p>

<p>“What, the King?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The King? Do I hear my ears, boy?”</p>

<p>“Uncle?”</p>

<p>“I am going to pull the latch-string, and out you go.
Don’t talk back. Do you hear? Out you go, and you
may never be able to tell <em>all</em> you lose.”</p>

<p>The boy half comprehended the hint, for he believed
that his uncle had money stored in the cellar, or in some
secret place near the house. As the latter would never
let any one but himself go to the soap-barrel in the cellar,
the boy suspected the treasure might be there, or in the
ash-flue in the chimney.</p>

<p>Young Peter turned white.</p>

<p>Old Peter tugged his rheumatic body to the door,
and turned.</p>

<p>“I am going to pull the string, Peter.”</p>

<p>To the boy the words sounded like a hangman’s
summons.</p>

<p>“Where shall I go, uncle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“That is for you to say. I’ve got store enough, boy.
Somebody will bury me if I die. But the King, my
King, he who goes against the King goes against me.
Who do you go for?”</p>

<p>“The people.”</p>

<p>“The people!” shrieked the old man. “Then <em>out</em>
you go; out!”</p>

<p>“There is one house, uncle, whose doors are open to
all people who have no roof.”</p>

<p>“Which one is that—the poorhouse?”</p>

<p>“No, the Governor’s.”</p>

<p>“That makes me mad—mad! I hate the Governor,
and his’n and all! I can live alone!”</p>

<p>He pulled the latch-string and cried, in trumpet tone:</p>

<p>“<em>Out!</em>”</p>

<p>Peter went out into the open April air, into the
wood. He went to the Governor’s, and told him all,
but in a way to shield the old man.</p>

<p>“He is a little touched in mind,” said Peter, charitably.</p>

<p>“You shall have a home with me, or mine,” said the
Governor. “My son-in-law over the way will employ
you as a shepherd. If he doesn’t, others will. And you
can use the hills for a lookout, while you herd sheep.
Dennis will find work for you to do at times in his service.
Boy, perilous times are coming, and you have a true
heart. I know your heart; I can see it—I know your
thoughts, and people who sow true thoughts, reap true
harvests. Don’t be down-hearted; you own the stars. I
will cover you.” He lifted his hand over him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“You won’t harm uncle for what I have said?”</p>

<p>“No, no, I will not harm the old man for what you
have said now. It is better to change the heart of a man
and make him your friend than to seek to have revenge
on him. He will turn to you some day, and perhaps he
will leave you his gold, for they say that he has gold
stored away somewhere. You have a heart of charity—I
can see—as well as of truth. Charity goes with honor.
As long as you do right, nothing can happen to you that
you can not glorify.”</p>

<p>Peter was made acquainted with Dennis by the Governor,
who was a father to all friendless children, and he
was employed as a shepherd boy, on the hills.</p>

<p>The hills were lookouts now.</p>

<p>People went to the old man to reprove him for his
treatment of his nephew, but he would only say:</p>

<p>“I am cutting wood!”</p>

<p>While he lived with his Tory uncle, Peter used to hear
strange things at night.</p>

<p>The old man would get up, bar all the doors, light the
bayberry candle, and bring something like a leather bag
to his table.</p>

<p>Then he would talk to himself strangely.</p>

<p>“<em>One</em>,” he would say, putting down something that
rang hard on the table.</p>

<p>“<em>One</em>, if he stays with me, and is true to the King.</p>

<p>“<em>Two.</em>”</p>

<p>There would follow a metallic sound.</p>

<p>“<em>Two</em>, if he stays with me, and is loyal to the King.</p>

<p>“<em>Three</em>, if he stays and is loyal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Four.</em> All for him when I go out, if only he is
true.”</p>

<p>Then the bag would jingle. Then would follow a
rattling sound.</p>

<p>“<em>Five</em>, <em>six</em>, <em>seven</em>, <em>eight</em>,” and so on, adding up to a
hundred. He seemed to be counting coin.</p>

<p>Then there would be a sound of sweeping hands.
Was he gathering up coin—gold coin? Presently there
would be sounds of chubby feet, and a chest would seem
to open, and the lid to close, and to be bolted.</p>

<p>“All, all for him,” the old man would say, “if he only
stays with me and is loyal to the King, whose arms are
like those of the lion and the unicorn.”</p>

<p>Then he would lie down, saying, “All for him,” and
the house would become still in the still world of the
cedars.</p>

<p>The boy wondered if “him” were the King, or if it
were he, or some unknown relative, or friend. He could
hardly doubt that the old man had treasure, and counted it
at night, either for the King, or for himself.</p>

<p>So now, often when the great moon shone on the
cedars, he lay awake and wondered what the old man
meant. Had he missed a fortune by his patriotic feeling?</p>

<p>The words, “if he stays with me and is loyal to the
King,” made him think that the wood-chopper meant himself,
or some unknown relative.</p>

<p>But “if he stays with me” suggested himself so
strongly, that he often asked himself, if the hard old man
really loved him and was carrying out some vision for his
welfare in his silent heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>Peter used to meet Brother Jonathan as the latter
crossed the green, which he did almost daily. The Governor
was usually so absorbed in thought that he did
not seem to see the shining sun, or to hear the birds singing;
he lived in the cause.</p>

<p>But when he met Peter he would stretch out his hand
in the Quaker manner, and look pleasant. To see the
old man’s face light up was a joy to the susceptible boy;
it made him so happy as to make him alert the rest of
the day.</p>

<p>One day as the two were crossing the green, in near
ways, the Governor suddenly said:</p>

<p>“Let us <em>consider</em> the matter:</p>

<p>“My young man, for so you are before your time, I
must have a clerk in my store, and he must be no common
clerk; he must be one that I can trust, for he must do
more than sell goods and barter; he must look out for
me, when I am in the back room, the war office; and he
must be the only one to enter the war-office room when
the council is in session. The council has met more than
three hundred times now. And, Peter, Peter of the hills,
shepherd-boy, night-watch—my heart turns to you. You
must be my clerk—that is, to the people; meet customers,
barter, trade, sell; but to me, you must be the sentinel of
the door of the war office. Peter, I can see your soul;
you will be true to me. I am an old man; don’t say it,
but I forget, when I have so many things to weigh me
down. You shall stand between the store and the war
office, at the counter, and I will give you the secret keys,
and if any one must see me, you must see about the matter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Peter, the Council of Safety is a power behind the destiny
of this nation. It is revealed to me so. Will you
come?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Governor. I live in my thoughts for you.
Yes, yes, and I will be as faithful as I can.”</p>

<p>“Of course you will. Come right now. You may
sleep in the store at night. The drovers will tell you
stories on the barrels. I can trust you for everything.
So I dismiss myself now—you are myself. Here is the
secret key. Don’t feel hurt if I do not speak to you
much when you see me. I live for the future, and must
think, think, think.”</p>

<p>The Governor went into the tavern, and Peter, with
the secret key, went to the store. The Governor had
considered the matter. He used the word <em>consider</em>
often.</p>

<p>The Governor soon began to send almost all people
who came to see him, except the members of the council,
to Peter. “Go to my clerk,” he would say, “he will do
the best he can for you.”</p>

<p>Peter rose in public favor. Two plus two in him
made five, as it does in all growing people. He was more
than a clerk. He was keen, hearty, true.</p>

<p>Peter received news from couriers for years. What
news was reported there—The battle of Long Island, the
operations near New York, Trenton, Princeton, Morristown,
Burgoyne’s campaign, Brandywine, Germantown,
Monmouth, the southern campaign, the exploits of Green,
and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of incidents of the varying
fortunes of the war!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>The couriers, despatchmen, the wagoners, the drovers,
came to the war office and went. They multiplied.</p>

<p>But the activity diminished as the army moved South.</p>

<p>People gathered in the front store in the evenings to
hear the news, and often to wait for the news. They saw
the members of the Council of Safety come and go; and
while the things that lay like weights in the balance of
the nation were there discussed, the men told tales on the
barrels that had come from the West Indies, or on the
meal chests and bins of vegetables. What queer tales
they were!</p>

<p>Let us spend an evening at the store, and listen to one
of the old Connecticut folk tales.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is a winter night. The ice glares without in the
moon, on the ponds and cedars. There is an open fire
in the store; in the window are candy-jars; over the
counter are candles on rods, and on the counter are snuff-jars
and tobacco.</p>

<p>One of the old-time natural story-tellers sits on a rice-barrel;
he is a drover and stops at wayside inns, and
knows the tales of the inns, and especially the ghost-stories.
Such stories did not frighten Peter as they did
Dennis, who was new to the country. Peter had become
hardened to them.</p>

<p>Let us give you one of these peculiar old store stories
that was told on red settles, and that is like those which
passed from settle to settle throughout the colony. The
speaker is a “grandfather.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>


<h3>THE TREASURE DIGGER OF CAPE ANN</h3>

<p>“Oh, boys, let me smoke my pipe in peace. How
the moon shines on the snow, far, far away, down the
sea! That makes me think of Captain Kidd. Ah, he
was a hard man, that same Captain Kidd, and he had a
hard, hard heart, if he was the son of a Scotch preacher.”</p>

<p>Here the grandfather paused and shook his head.</p>

<p>The pause made an atmosphere. The natural story-teller
lowered his voice, and the earth seemed to stand
still as he said:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My name was Captain Kidd,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As I sailed, as I sailed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">My name was Captain Kidd,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">As I sailed.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My name was Captain Kidd,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And wickedly I did,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">God’s laws I did forbid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">As I sailed.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I murdered William Moore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As I sailed, as I sailed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And left him in his gore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">As I sailed.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’d the Bible in my hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">’Twas my father’s last command,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But I sunk it in the sand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">As I sailed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Here the old man paused, pressed down the tobacco
in his pipe with a quick movement of his forefinger, and
shook his head twice, leaving the impression that the said
Captain Kidd was a very bad sea-rover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The room was still. You could hear the sparks shoot
out; the corn-sheller stopped in his work. The old maiden
lady who had come in for snuff touched the pepper pods:
the air grew peppery, but no one dared to sneeze.</p>

<p>The old man bobbed up his head, as making an atmosphere
for highly wrought work of the imagination.</p>

<p>“There was once an old couple,” he said, “who lived
down on Cape Ann, and beyond their cottage was a sandy
dune, and on the dune there was a thatch-patch.</p>

<p>“They had grown old and were poor, and both thought
that their lot had been hard, and the old woman said to
the old man:</p>

<p>“‘It was you who made my life hard. I was once
a girl, and what I might have been no one knows. Ah
me, ah me!’</p>

<p>“One fall morning the old man got up, and frisked
around in an unusual way.</p>

<p>“‘What makes you so spry?’ asked the old woman.</p>

<p>“‘I dreamed a dream last night in the morning.’</p>

<p>“‘And what did you dream?’</p>

<p>“‘I dreamed that Captain Kidd hid his treasure in an
iron box under the thatch-patch, right in the middle of
the patch, where the shingle goes round.’</p>

<p>“‘Then go out and dig. If you don’t, I will. Think
what we might be, if we could find that treasure. We
might have a chariot like the Pepperells, and fine horses
like the Boston gentry, the Royalls, and the Vassals.’</p>

<p>“‘But I can have the treasure only on one condition.’</p>

<p>“‘What is that?’</p>

<p>“‘I must not speak a word while I am digging.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>“‘That would be hard for you. Your mouth is
always open, answering your old wife back. I could dig
without a word, now. Well, well, ah-a-me! If you should
dream that dream a second time, it would be a sign.’</p>

<p>“The next morning the old man got up spryer than
before. He clattered the shovel and the tongs.</p>

<p>“‘Wife, wife, I dreamed the same dream again this
morning.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, if you were to dream it a third time, it would
be a certainty—that is, if you could dig for the treasure
without speaking a word, which a woman of my sense
and wit could do. Go and dig.’</p>

<p>“‘But the voice that came to me in my dream told
me to dig at midnight, at the rising of the moon.’</p>

<p>“That night as the great moon rose over the waters
of Cape Ann, like the sun, the old man took his hoe and
hung on to it his clam-basket, and put both of them over
his shoulder. He went out of the door over which the
dry morning-glory vines were rattling.</p>

<p>“‘Now, husband, you stop and listen to me,’ said the
old wife. ‘Remember all the time that you are not to
speak a word, else we will have no chariot to ride past
the Pepperells, nor cantering horses, leaving the dust all
in their eyes. Now, what are you to do?’</p>

<p>“‘Never to speak a word.’</p>

<p>“‘Under no surprise.’</p>

<p>“‘Not if the sea were to roar, nor the sky to fall,
nor an earthquake to uproot the hills, nor anything!’</p>

<p>“‘Well, you may go now, and when you return we
will be richer than the Governor himself. I have always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
been dreaming that such a day might come to us as a sort
of reward for all that we have suffered. But they say
that Captain Kidd tricks those who dig for his treasures.
His ghost appears to them. Never you fear if he lays
hands on you.’</p>

<p>“The old man went down to the sea. The moon rose
so fast that he could see it rising.</p>

<p>“The old couple had a black cat, a very sleek, fat
little animal, which lived much on the broken clams that
the clam-diggers threw out of their piles of bivalves at
low tides.</p>

<p>“When she saw that the old man was going down
to the sea, she started after him, with still feet—still,
still.</p>

<p>“The old man measured by his eye the center of the
thatch-patch, and dug into the tough roots of the thatch
lustily. He became exhausted at last and stopped to
rest, looking up to the moon that glittered in the autumn
sea. He pushed the handle of the hoe down into the
sand. It struck something that sounded like iron. He
felt sure of the treasure.</p>

<p>“Suddenly he felt something rubbing against his leg.
It was like a hand. ‘Captain Kidd came back to disconcert
me,’ thought he. ‘But I will never speak a
word,’ thought he silently, ‘not for the moon herself, nor
for a thousand moons.’</p>

<p>“The supposed hand again rubbed against his leg—still,
still.</p>

<p>“He turned his head very slowly and cautiously. He
saw something move. It was like a gloved hand. ‘Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Kidd’s, sure,’ he thought, but did not speak a word.
The thing had still feet or hands.</p>

<p>“He turned his head a little more and was humbled
to discover that it was not Captain Kidd’s hand at all, but
only Tommy, purring and purring—still, still.</p>

<p>“His pride fell. He was disconcerted. No one can
tell what he may do when he finds a pirate’s ghost to be
only the house cat, all so still.</p>

<p>“There are some situations that take away all one’s
senses, little things, too.</p>

<p>“He inclined his head more, so to be certain, when
the truth was in an instant revealed to him beyond a
possibility of doubt, but everything was still, still, still.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Scat!</span>’”</p>

<p>The story-teller had been talking in a very low tone.
He uttered the last word with an explosive voice when he
had caused all ears to be strained. His hearers leaped at
this electric ending of his Red Settle Tale.</p>

<p>He resumed his pipe, and merely added:</p>

<p>“There are some things that human nature can not
stand. When a man finds out something to be nothing,
for example, like the treasure digger of Cape Ann.”</p>

<p>After a long time, during which heart-beats became
normal, some one might venture to ask:</p>

<p>“And what became of the old woman?”</p>

<p>“Oh, after the old man spoke the sea roared and
came rushing into the thatch-patch and over it, and he
and the cat ran, and I mind me that that cat didn’t have
much peace and comfort in the house after that.”</p>

<small>THE WAR OFFICE IN THE CEDARS—AN INDIAN TALE—INCIDENTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The old war office at Lebanon, Conn., is still to be
seen. That war office is a relic room and a library
now. The great cedars are gone that once surrounded
it, and the old Alden Tavern, which was enlivened by
colonial tales, and in later times by the queer Revolutionary
tale of the humiliation of the captured Prescott,
has now left behind it the borders of the village
green. The ground where Washington reviewed the
army of Rochambeau is still held sacred, and near by
rises the church of the Revolution, and in a wind-swept
New England graveyard, on the hillside, in a crumbling
tomb, sleeps Governor Trumbull, Washington’s “Brother
Jonathan,” whom the great leader of the soldier commoners
used to consult in every stress of the war.</p>

<p>In the same lot of rude, mossy, zigzag headstones rests
one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence,
William Williams, who married Governor Trumbull’s
daughter.</p>

<p>This place of rare history stands apart from the main
traveled roads. To reach it, go to Willimantic, and take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
a branch railroad to Lebanon, which town of hidden
farms was so called from its cedars.</p>

<p>What a wonder to a lover of history this place is!
The farms, with orchards, great barns and meadows, rise
on the hill-slopes as beautiful as they are thrifty. The
town is some two or more miles from the railroad, and
the visitor wonders how a place that decided the greatest
events of history could have been left to primitive life,
simplicity, and country roads, amid all the industrial
activities that circle round it in near great factory towns.</p>

<p>There may be seen the New England of old—the
same bowery landscapes and walls that the rugged
farmers knew, who left their plows for Bunker Hill,
after the Lexington alarm. Putnam often rode over
these hills, and young John Trumbull, as we have shown,
began his historical pictures there.</p>

<p>The little gambrel-roofed house called the war office,
where the greatest and most decisive events of the Revolution
had their origin, or support, was probably the country
store of Governor Trumbull’s father, and was erected
near the beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Why did this little building gain this great importance,
an importance greater than any other, except, perhaps,
the old State House, Boston, and Independence
Hall, Philadelphia? Let us repeat some facts for clearness.</p>

<p>Lebanon of the cedars lay on the direct road to Boston,
and was connected with the principal Connecticut
towns. There was sounded the Lexington alarm. The
Connecticut Assembly delegated great powers to a committee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of public safety. Governor Trumbull, who was
the leading spirit of it, and three other members, resided
in Lebanon, and held the early sessions of the committee
there. This committee continued its sessions here during
the war.</p>

<p>The <a href="#i_fp060">house</a> occupied by Governor Trumbull still
stands, as we have said, but the tavern is gone.</p>

Connecticut.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The writer dined in the house a few months before
beginning this story, and was shown the part of the house
where the alarm-post, as we call the guard’s room, and
overlook, were.</p>

<p>We give a picture of this most interesting house, one
of the most significant in the country. The spirit of the
Revolution dwelt there, and from this place it exercised
a wonderful but unseen power.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Society of the Sons of the Revolution
in the winter of 1890–’91 made provision for the
preservation of the war office, as a notable relic of the
Revolution.</p>

<p>The building was repaired. The oak framework was
found to be sound, and the decayed sills were replaced
by new timber, and the chimney was restored and furnished
with colonial firepieces from old houses in Lebanon.
Andirons made in the Revolution, old iron cranes,
and primitive utensils were brought to the council room,
and the place of the meetings of the Committee of Public
Safety was thus made to resume the aspect of a bygone
age of the farmer heroes.</p>

<p>The celebration of the restoration of the war office
by the Sons of the Revolution took place May 14, 1891,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
on Flag-day, when there waved a flag with the motto
of “Brother Jonathan” in company with the Star-Spangled
Banner.</p>

<p>On that occasion the modern American flag was raised
over the old war office for the first time, where</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">In his store on Lebanon Hill.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Jonathan Trumbull has well been called the Cedar of
Lebanon. The story of his early life is that of one of
nature’s independent noblemen, than which no title is
higher. His own brains and hands caused him to be a
powerful influence; he made character, and character made
him; he became poor, but nothing lives but righteousness,
and character is everything.</p>

<p>The origin of his family name is interesting.</p>

<p>A Scottish king was out hunting, and was attacked
by a bull. A young peasant threw himself before the
king, twisted the bull’s horns, and saved the king’s life.
The king gave him the name of “Turnbull,” with a coat
of arms and the motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fortuna favet audaci</i>. Hence
the name Trumbull.</p>

<p>The wife of Trumbull, as we have shown, came from a
family equally noble. She was the great-granddaughter
of Robinson of Leyden, the patriarch of the church of the
Pilgrim Fathers in Holland. It was he who said to the
Pilgrims on their departure: “Go ye forth into the
wilderness, and new light shall break forth from the
Word.”</p>

<p>He had intended to follow the Pilgrims to America,
but died in Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Jonathan Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Conn.,
1710. He was a successful trader at sea for a time; he
then lost his ships and property and became a poor man,
when he was called into the public service, and from that
time devoted himself to patriotic duties, without any
thought of poverty or riches, but only to fulfil the duties
into which he had been called. He lived not for himself,
but for others; not for the present, but for the future; he
forgot himself, and it was fame.</p>

<p>His son, John Trumbull, the famous historical painter,
pictures by anecdotes some of the scenes of his early
home. Among these incidents is the following story,
which carries its own lesson:</p>


<h3>AN INDIAN TALE</h3>

<p>“At the age of nine or ten a circumstance occurred
which deserves to be written on adamant. In the wars
of New England with the aborigines, the Mohegan tribe
of Indians early became friends of the English. Their
favorite ground was on the banks of the river (now the
Thames) between New London and Norwich. A small
remnant of the Mohegans still exists, and they are sacredly
protected in the possession and enjoyment of their
favorite domain on the banks of the Thames. The government
of this tribe had become hereditary in the family
of the celebrated chief Uncas. During the time of my
father’s mercantile prosperity he had employed several
Indians of this tribe in hunting animals, whose skins were
valuable for their fur. Among these hunters was one
named Zachary, of the royal race, an excellent hunter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
but as drunken and worthless an Indian as ever lived.
When he had somewhat passed the age of fifty, several
members of the royal family who stood between Zachary
and the throne of his tribe died, and he found himself
with only one life between him and empire. In this
moment his better genius resumed its sway, and he
reflected seriously. ‘How can such a drunken wretch
as I am aspire to be the chief of this honorable race—what
will my people say—and how will the shades of my
noble ancestors look down indignant upon such a base
successor? Can I succeed to the great Uncas? I will
drink no more!’ He solemnly resolved never again to
taste any drink but water, and he kept his resolution.</p>

<p>“I had heard this story, and did not entirely believe
it; for young as I was, I already partook in the prevailing
contempt for Indians. In the beginning of May, the
annual election of the principal officers of the (then)
colony was held at Hartford, the capital. My father
attended officially, and it was customary for the chief of
the Mohegans also to attend.</p>

<p>“Zachary had succeeded to the rule of his tribe. My
father’s house was situated about midway on the road
between Mohegan and Hartford, and the old chief was
in the habit of coming a few days before the election
and dining with his brother governor. One day the
mischievous thought struck me, to try the sincerity of
the old man’s temperance. The family were seated at
dinner, and there was excellent home-brewed beer on the
table. I addressed the old chief: ‘Zachary, this beer is
excellent; will you taste it?’ The old man dropped his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
knife and fork, leaning forward with a stern intensity of
expression; his black eye, sparkling with indignation, was
fixed on me. ‘John,’ said he, ‘you do not know what you
are doing. You are serving the devil, boy! Do you not
know that I am an Indian? I tell you that I am, and
that, if I should but taste your beer, I could never stop
until I got to rum, and became again the drunken, contemptible
wretch your father remembers me to have
been. <em>John, while you live never again tempt any man
to break a good resolution.</em>’</p>

<p>“Socrates never uttered a more valuable precept;
Demosthenes could not have given it in more solemn
tones of eloquence. I was thunderstruck. My parents
were deeply affected; they looked at each other, at me,
and at the venerable old Indian, with deep feelings of
awe and respect. They afterward frequently reminded
me of the scene, and charged me never to forget it.</p>

<p>“Zachary lived to pass the age of eighty, and sacredly
kept his resolution. He lies buried in the royal burial-place
of his tribe, near the beautiful falls of the Yantic,
the western branch of the Thames, in Norwich, on land
now owned by my friend, Calvin Goddard, Esq. I visited
the grave of the old chief lately, and there repeated to
myself his inestimable lesson.”</p>

<p>Mr. Trumbull, the painter, also thus pictures his own
youth, and what a character it presents in the studies he
made, and the books he read!</p>

<p>“About this time, when I was nine or ten years old,
my father’s mercantile failure took place. He had been
for years a successful merchant, and looked forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
to an old age of ease and affluence; but in one season
almost every vessel, and all the property which he had
upon the ocean, was swept away, and he was a poor man
at so late a period of life as left no hope of retrieving
his affairs.</p>

<p>“My eldest brother was involved in the wreck as a
partner, which rendered the condition of the family
utterly hopeless. My mother and sisters were deeply
afflicted, and although I was too young clearly to comprehend
the cause, yet sympathy led me too to droop.
My bodily health was frail, for the sufferings of early
youth had left their impress on my constitution, and
although my mind was clear and the body active, it was
never strong. I therefore seldom joined my little schoolfellows
in plays or exercises of an athletic kind, for there
I was almost sure to be vanquished; and by degrees acquired
new fondness for drawing, in which I stood unrivaled.
Thus I gradually contracted a solitary habit,
and after school hours frequently withdrew to my own
room to a close study of my favorite pursuit.</p>

<p>“Such was my character at the time of my father’s
failure, and this added gloomy feelings to my love of
solitude. I became silent, diffident, bashful, awkward in
society, and took refuge in still closer application to my
books and my drawing.</p>

<p>“The want of pocket-money prevented me from joining
my young companions in any of those little expensive
frolics which often lead to future dissipation, and thus
became a blessing; and my good master Tisdale had the
wisdom so to vary my studies as to render them rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
a pleasure than a task. Thus I went forward, without
interruption, and at the age of twelve might have been
admitted to enter college; for I had then read Eutropius,
Cornelius Nepos, Virgil, Cicero, Horace, and Juvenal
in Latin; the Greek Testament and Homer’s Iliad in
Greek, and was thoroughly versed in geography, ancient
and modern, in studying which I had the advantage
(then rare) of a twenty-inch globe. I had also read with
care Rollin’s History of Ancient Nations; also his History
of the Roman Republic; Mr. Crevier’s continuation of
the History of the Emperors, and Rollin’s Arts and
Sciences of the Ancient Nations. In arithmetic alone I
met an awful stumbling-block. I became puzzled by a
sum in division, where the divisor consisted of three
figures. I could not comprehend the rule for ascertaining
how many times it was contained in the dividend;
my mind seemed to come to a dead stand; my master
would not assist me, and forbade the boys to do it, so that
I well recollect the question stood on my slate unsolved
nearly three months, to my extreme mortification.</p>

<p>“At length the solution seemed to flash upon my mind
at once, and I went forward without further let or hindrance
through the ordinary course of fractions, vulgar
and decimal, surveying, trigonometry, geometry, navigation,
etc., so that when I had reached the age of fifteen
and a half years, it was stated by my good master
that he could teach me little more, and that I was fully
qualified to enter Harvard College in the middle of the
third or junior year. This was approved by my father,
and proposed to me. In the meantime my fondness for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
painting had grown with my growth, and in reading of
the arts of antiquity I had become familiar with the
names of Phidias and Praxiteles, of Zeuxis and Apelles.”</p>

<p>This son, who began his great career as an historical
painter by drawing pictures in sand on the floor, after the
manner we have shown, as he grew older and had seen
Europe, determined to follow his genius. The young man
gives us the following view of his father, a lovely picture
in itself:</p>

<p>“My father urged me to study the law as the profession
which in a republic leads to all emolument and
distinction, and for which my early education had well
prepared me. My reply was that, so far as I understood
the question, law was rendered necessary by the vices of
mankind; that I had already seen too much of them willingly
to devote my life to a profession which would keep
me perpetually involved either in the defense of innocence
against fraud and injustice, or (what was much more revolting
to an ingenuous mind) to the protection of guilt
against just and merited punishment. In short, I pined
for the arts, again entered into an elaborate defense of my
predilection, and again dwelt upon the honors paid to
artists in the glorious days of Greece and Athens. My
father listened patiently, and when I had finished he complimented
me upon the able manner in which I had defended
what to him still appeared to be a bad cause.</p>

<p>“‘I had confirmed his opinion,’ he said, ‘that with
proper study I should make a respectable lawyer; but,’
added he, ‘you must give me leave to say that you
appear to have overlooked, or forgotten, one very important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
point in your case.’ ‘Pray, sir,’ I rejoined, ‘what
was that?’ ‘You appear to forget, sir, that <em>Connecticut
is not Athens</em>’; and with this pithy remark he bowed
and withdrew, and never more opened his lips upon the
subject. How often have those few impressive words
occurred to my memory—‘Connecticut is not Athens!’
The decision was made in favor of the arts. I closed all
other business, and in December, 1783, embarked at
Portsmouth, N. H., for London.”</p>

<p>He could begin to make Connecticut like Athens by
his own work.</p>

<p>Queer tales they told “grave people” at the ordinaries,
and inns, and at the store of the war office.</p>

<p>The New England mind in the colonial period saw
no chariots of angels in the air, and heard no rustlings of
angels’ wings, like the ancient Hebrews, and looked for
no goddesses, like the Greeks and Romans. Ugly hags
and witches, “grave people” in winding-sheets, scared
folks in a cowardly manner in lonely highways and hidden
byways; bad people who died with restless consciences
came forth from their “earthly beds” to make startling
confessions to the living. It was a time of terror, of
people fleeing from persecutions, and of Indian hostilities.
Let us have another old-time store story, to picture
the social life of those decisive times.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the days of the “drovers,”
when our tale was told, such drovers as used to go wandering
over New England in the fall and spring, selling
cattle, or trading in cattle, with the farmers by the way.</p>

<p>It was fall. Maples flamed; the grape-leaves turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
yellow around the purple clusters that hung over the
walls; the fringed gentians lined the brooks; the cranberries
reddened; the birds gathered in flocks; the blue
jays trumpeted, and the crows cawed. Great stacks of
corn filled the corners of the husking-fields.</p>

<p>The drovers came to the valleys of the Connecticut
and to the Berkshire Hills, and rested at last with full
purses at the Plainfield Inn.</p>

<p>In the inn lived an aunt of the innkeeper, a Quaker
woman by the name of Eunice.</p>

<p>There was a young drover named Mordecai, who was
all imagination, eyes and ears. He seemed to be so
earnest to learn everything that he attracted the notice
of Eunice, and she said to him on one of his annual
visits:</p>

<p>“Mordecai, and who may thy father be?”</p>

<p>“Gone—gone with the winds. That’s him.”</p>

<p>“And thy mother?”</p>

<p>“Gone—gone after him. That’s her. Where do
you suppose they are?”</p>

<p>“Did they leave anything?”</p>

<p>“Left all they had.”</p>

<p>“And how much was that, Mordecai?”</p>

<p>“The earth—all.”</p>

<p>“And thou wert left all alone. I pity thee,
Mordecai.”</p>

<p>Now, Quaker Eunice knit. She not only knit stockings
and garters, but comforters for the neck, and gallows,
as suspenders for trousers were then called. The latter
were called <em>galluses</em>. She did not knit these useful and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
convenient articles for her own people alone, but for
those who most needed them.</p>

<p>When serene Aunt Eunice saw how friendless the
drover boy Mordecai was, her benevolent heart quickened,
and she resolved to knit for him a comforter of many
bright colors, a yard long, and a pair of gallows of stout
twine, to give him on his return another year, when the
cattle traders should come down from Boston. It took
time to fabricate these high-art treasures of many kinds
and colors. So when Mordecai was leaving the inn this
year, she called after him:</p>

<p>“Mordecai, thee halt in thy goings.”</p>

<p>Mordecai looked back.</p>

<p>“Boy, thee has no mother to look after thee now,
except from the spirit-world. I am going to knit a comforter
for thee that will go around thy neck three times
and hang down at that. I will set the dye-pot and dye
the wool—the ash-barrel is almost full now. And thee
listen. I am going to knit a pair of gallows for
thee——”</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes dilated. He had never heard the
word used before except for the cords that hung pirates
on the green isle in Boston harbor. Did she expect him
to be hung?</p>

<p>“I will knit the gallows stout and strong, so that they
will hold. But I must not tell thee all about it now—thee
shall know all another year, after killing-time, in the
Indian summer, when the wich-hazels that bloom in the
fall are in flower.”</p>

<p>Mordecai, who had been filled with New England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
superstitions by the drovers’ tales in the country inns,
stood with open mouth, when Aunt Eunice added:</p>

<p>“I am going to put a new invention on those gallows;
it will prove a surprise to thee.”</p>

<p>It did.</p>

<p>The boy Mordecai passed a year in wonder at what
the zigzag journey to hill towns at the west of the State
would bring him in the holiday or rest seasons of the fall.
He wandered with the drovers to the towns around
Boston, and on the Charles and “Merrimack,” trading
and selling cattle, and “putting up” at the inns by the
way, he himself sleeping in the barns, under the swallows’
nests.</p>

<p>They were merry merchantmen, the drovers. Whittier
describes them in a poem. Their cattle trades had
a dialect of its own, and there was an unwritten law that
“all was fair in trade,” to which “honorable dishonesty”
clear-minded Aunt Eunice made objection, and against
which she “delivered exhortations.”</p>

<p>Some of these merry rovers used a boy to help them
in tricks of trade—to shorten the age of cattle, and the
time when the latter were “broke,” and like matters.</p>

<p>One day in the spring tradings a Quaker on one of the
Salem farms said to Mordecai:</p>

<p>“Boy, thee must never let thy tongue slip an untruth,
or thee will come to the gallows.”</p>

<p>The next year the drovers and Mordecai took their
annual journey from Cambridge to Springfield and eastern
Connecticut, and stopped at the Plainfield Inn.</p>

<p>The trees flamed with autumnal splendors again; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
sun seemed burning in the air, now with a clear flame, now
with a smoky haze; there were great corn harvests everywhere.
The twilight and early evening hours were still.
The voices on the farms echoed—those of the huskers,
and of the boys driving the oxen, with carts loaded with
corn. The hunters’ moon that rose over the hills like a
night sun lengthened out the day.</p>

<p>They went on slowly, and so allowing their cattle to
graze on the succulent grasses by the roadside, and to
fatten, and become lazy.</p>

<p>They rested at great farmhouses, bartering and selling
as long as the light of the day lasted, and telling
awful tales of the Indian wars and old Salem witchcraft
days later in the evening.</p>

<p>Some of the drovers’ stories were awful indeed.
One of them concerned the “Miller of Durham.” The
said miller used to remain in his mill late in the evening
alone. One night he was startled by the dripping of
water inside of the mill-house. He turned from the
hopper, and saw there a woman, with five bloody wounds,
and wet garments, and wide eyes.</p>

<p>“Miller of Durham,” she said, “you must avenge me,
or I will haunt the mill. You will find my body in the
well in the abandoned coal-pit. Mattox killed me—he
knows why.”</p>

<p>The miller knew Mattox, and he saw that the woman
had a familiar look, and had probably been employed on
the farm of the accused man, who was a prosperous
farmer. He resolved to conceal the appearance of the
accusing ghost. But the apparition followed him, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
so made his life a terror that he went perforce to a magistrate
and made confession. The woman’s body, with five
wounds, was found in the well of the coal-pit, and Mattox
was accused of the murder, tried, condemned, and executed.
The story was a true one, but it was an old one.
The events occurred in England on a moor.</p>

<p>The boy Mordecai listened to these inn tales at first
with a clear conscience, and he felt secure, for he had
been taught that innocence renders “apparitions” harmless;
but after a time his moral condition changed, and his
fears were aroused, and they grew into terrors.</p>

<p>For one day, as the lively cattle-owner was driving
a bargain with a rich farmer under some great elms that
rose like hills of greenery by the roadside, he declared
that a certain cow had given fifteen quarts of milk a day
during the summer, and had said, “There is the boy that
milked her—the boy Mordecai, he of the Old Testament
name. Speak up, Mordecai. You milked her, didn’t you,
now?”</p>

<p>Mordecai stood silent. The cow had given some eight
or ten quarts of milk a day.</p>

<p>“He can’t deny that he milked her,” said the bantering
trader.</p>

<p>“And did she give fifteen quarts of milk regularly
during the summer, boy?” asked the farmer.</p>

<p>“I did not measure the milk myself,” said the boy.
“The boss did that.”</p>

<p>“That was I, or rather my wife,” said the drover.</p>

<p>Mordecai’s conscience began to be disturbed, and disturbed
consciences are the stuff out of which ghosts grow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>At the next inn, in the lovely Connecticut valley, a
still more terrible story was told. A forest tavern-keeper,
after this tale, had trained a huge mastiff to drown his
rich guests in a pond in a wood at the back of the tavern.
The strong dog had been bought of a drover named
Bonny, who had treated him kindly. Years passed, and
the same Mr. Bonny visited the inn, and was recognized
by the dog, but not by the tavern-keeper. The latter
invited Mr. Bonny to go with him to the trout-pond in
the wood, and while they were on the margin of the
pond he suddenly whistled to his mastiff as a signal.
The dog whined and howled and ran around in a
circle.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do as you always do?” exclaimed
the tavern-keeper to the dog in anger.</p>

<p>The dog’s eyes blazed; he leaped upon his master and
dragged him into the pond. But his master in his struggles
drowned the mastiff. Mr. Bonny witnessed the scene
in horror, and seeing what it meant—for several rich
drovers had disappeared from the inn and had never been
heard of again—he determined to conceal the matter,
as the crime could not be repeated. But the dead dog
howled nights, and so drew people to the pond, and disclosed
the crime.</p>

<p>“Life,” said the story-teller, “is self-revealing: everything
is found out at last. The stars in their courses
fight against a liar!”</p>

<p>The inward eyes of Mordecai now began to expect to
see “sights.” The boy’s conscience burned. He had
the ghost atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>The next time that the lusty drover tried to sell the
cow that had given “fifteen quarts of milk a day” he
declared that she had given sixteen quarts, and called the
milker as before to witness the statement.</p>

<p>“You milked her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; but you measured the milk,” said Mordecai.</p>

<p>“So I did,” said the drover in an absent tone in which
was the usual false note, “so I did. I remember now.
But you used to milk her.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” faltered the boy, feeling that the heavens were
likely to fall or the earth to cave in.</p>

<p>The story at the next inn, near Pittsfield, on the Albany
way, outdid all the rest. A man who had robbed
his neighbors by deception, after this story, had been
followed nights by the clanking of an invisible chain. A
neighbor whom he had ruined died, and after that the
clankings of the “invisible chain” began to be heard in
his bedchamber. If he ran down-stairs they followed
him, clank, clank, clank, on the oak steps, and out into
the garden.</p>

<p>Mordecai could fancy it all: the man running half-crazed
down the oak stairs, with the invisible chain clanking
behind him.</p>

<p>When the drover next tried to sell that cow he declared
that she had given “eighteen quarts of milk a
day,” to which he called Mordecai to witness. The boy
gasped “Yes” to the question if he had milked her regularly,
but he seemed to hear the clanking of the invisible
chain as he acted his part for the last time. The wonderful
cow was sold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>In this state of mind Mordecai came to the Plainfield
Inn, and again met there the serene and truthful Aunt
Eunice.</p>

<p>“I’ve kept my promise that I made to thee a year
ago,” said the sympathetic woman, “gallows and all. The
dyestuff took, and the colors of the comforter are real
pretty. Thee looks troubled.”</p>

<p>Near midnight the foresticks in the fireplace broke
and fell, and the men went to their rooms.</p>

<p>“Thee will sleep in the cockloft,” said Aunt Eunice
to Mordecai, “but before thee goes up let me sew
some buttons on thy trousers for the gallows [galluses].
Stand up by me; I have some stout thread for the purpose.”</p>

<p>Mordecai took off his jacket and loosened his belt, and
Aunt Eunice sewed on the buttons as he stood beside her.
She then attached the gallows to the back buttons, leaving
them otherwise free for him to button on in front
in the morning.</p>

<p>“See here, Mordecai,” she said. “These are no common
gallows. I’ve put buckles on them—buckles that
my grandfather wore in the Indian wars. These are
wonderful buckles. If the gallows are too long, thee
can h’ist them up, so; if they are then too short, thee
can let them out again, so.”</p>

<p>Now, when Mordecai saw that the gallows had no
connection with hanging he felt happy, and he went up
to the cockloft, candle in hand.</p>

<p>“Be careful and not let the buckles drag upon the
floor, Mordecai,” were the good woman’s last words as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
she saw the boy disappear with the light, holding the
wonderful suspenders in his hand.</p>

<p>Mordecai could not sleep. The cockloft did not look
right, did not fulfil his moral ideal. The great moon
rose over the hills and flooded the valley with white
light. He began to think of the three acted lies of which
he had been a part. The cow that had given “fifteen,”
“sixteen,” “seventeen,” “eighteen” quarts of milk a day
had been sold—what if the purchaser should commit
suicide?</p>

<p>At midnight he heard a cry out in the field.</p>

<p>“Hello! that steer is out and is at the corn-stack!”</p>

<p>The voice was that of a drover. Mordecai felt that
he should get up and go to the corn-stack and help impound
the steer.</p>

<p>He forgot the gallows, so they hung down to the
floor behind him after he had dressed. He tried to
light the candle after the old slow way, for the ladder to
the cockloft was “poky,” when he heard something clink
behind him. He turned around, when an iron hoof
seemed to follow him around, clink, clink, clink. The
sound was not alarming or vengeful or in a way terrible,
but to his imagination it shook the roof.</p>

<p>He whirled around again.</p>

<p>Clink, clink!</p>

<p>Again.</p>

<p>Clink!</p>

<p>His heart seemed bursting, his brain to be on fire.
He rushed toward the ladder and the “thing” followed
him. He attempted to go down the ladder, but after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
some steps the “thing” held him back, when he uttered
a cry that shook the whole tavern and made the people
leap from their beds.</p>

<p>“Hel-up! Hel-up! Let go! Let go!”</p>

<p>The landlord came running, and saw the situation.</p>

<p>“I never thought that you would come to the gallows,”
said he, “but you have!”</p>

<p>“All the powers have mercy on me now!” cried Mordecai.
“But I’ll confess. Will you let me go if I confess?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the landlord. “What have you on
your mind?”</p>

<p>The drovers came running in.</p>

<p>“That cow didn’t give no fifteen quarts. I connived.
The drover put me up to it—the Lord of massy, what will
become of his soul? I’ll never connive again!”</p>

<p>Then said the landlord:</p>

<p>“I’ll have to let you go.”</p>

<p>He unloosened the “galluses,” which had wound
around a rung in the ladder, and Mordecai kept his conscience
clear even in cattle trade ever after.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>THE DECISIVE DAY OF BROTHER JONATHAN’S LIFE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Before we leave this part of our subject we should
study the event that made the great character of the
Governor.</p>

<p>All lives have decisive days. Such a day determined
the great destiny of Jonathan Trumbull.</p>

<p>The stamp act had been passed in Parliament, by
which a stamp duty was imposed upon all American paper
that should be used to transact business and upon articles
essential to life. Persons were to be appointed to sell
stamps for the purpose. This was taxation without representation
in Parliament, and was regarded as tyranny
in America.</p>

<p>All persons holding office under England were required
to make oath that they would support the stamp
duty. Among these were the Governor of Connecticut
and his ten councilors, and one of these councilors at that
time was Jonathan Trumbull.</p>

<p>The day arrived on which the Governor, whose name
was Fitch, and his councilors assembled to take the oath
or to resign their commissions.</p>

<p>“I am ready to be sworn,” said the then Governor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
“The sovereignty of England demands it. Are you
all ready?”</p>

<p>There was a grave silence.</p>

<p>Jonathan Trumbull rose.</p>

<p>“The stamp act,” said he, “is a derogation of the
chartered rights of the colony. It takes away our freedom.
The power that can tax us as it pleases can govern
us as it pleases. The stamp act takes away our liberties
and robs us of everything. It makes us slaves and can
reduce us to poverty. I can not take the oath.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the royal Governor, “the officers of his
Majesty must obey his commands or not hold his commissions.
For you to refuse to be sworn is contempt of
Parliament. The King’s displeasure is fatal. Gentlemen,
I am ready for the oath, and I ask that it be now administered
to me.”</p>

<p>The Governors of all the provinces except Rhode
Island had taken the oath. Even Franklin and Otis and
Richard Henry Lee had decided to submit to the act of
unrestrained tyranny. They thought it politic to do so.</p>

<p>But Trumbull’s conscience rose supreme over every
argument and consideration. In conscience he was strong,
as any one may be.</p>

<p>“I <em>can not</em> take the oath,” said Trumbull. “Let Parliament
do its worst, and its armies and navies thunder.
I will not violate my provincial oath, which I deem to
be right. I will be true to Connecticut, and to the liberties
of man. You have sworn by the awful name of
Almighty God to be true to the rights of this colony.
I have so sworn, and that oath will I keep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>It was near the close of the day. The red sun was
setting, casting his glimmering splendors over the pines.
The oath was about to be administered by the royal Governor.</p>

<p>Jonathan Trumbull rose up among the councilors. His
soul had arisen to a sublime height, and despised all human
penalties or martyrs’ fires.</p>

<p>His intense eyes bespoke the thoughts that were burning
within him.</p>

<p>He did not speak. He was about to make his conduct
more eloquent than words.</p>

<p>He seized his tricornered hat, and gave back a look
that said, “I will not disgrace myself by witnessing such
a ceremony of degradation.” He moved toward the
door.</p>

<p>His every motion betokened his self-command, his
soul value, his uncompromising obedience to the law of
right. Erect, austere, he retreated from the shadow of
the room, into the burning light of the sunset.</p>

<p>He closed the door behind him, and breathed his
native air.</p>

<p>Six of the councilors followed him—six patriot seceders.</p>

<p>That was a notable day for liberty: it made Trumbull
a power, though he could not see it.</p>

<p>The people upheld Trumbull. At the next election
they cast out of office the Governor and those of his councilors
who had received the oath, and Connecticut was
free.</p>

<p>In a short time the people made Jonathan Trumbull,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
who risked all by leaving the room at the dusk of that
decisive day, their Governor, and they continued him in
office until his hair turned white, and he heard the town
bells all ringing for the independence and peace of
America.</p>

<p>Had his act cost him his life he would have done the
same. He would have owned his soul. Honor to him
was more than life—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My life and honor both together run;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take honor from me and my life is done.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When “Brother Jonathan” returned to Lebanon he
was greeted by all hearts. The rugged farmers gathered
on the green around him with lifted hats. The children
hailed him, even the Indian children. The dogs barked,
and when the bell rang out, it rang true to his ears;
for him forever the bell of life rang true.</p>

<p>But his life was forfeited to the Crown. What of
that? His soul was safe in the Almighty, and he slept
in peace, lulled to rest by the whispering cedars. So
began the great public career of Trumbull. He was
chosen Lieutenant-Governor in 1766, and Governor in
1769.</p>

<p>He was made the chairman of the Connecticut Council
of Public Safety, which met at his war office, which
at first was a protected room in his little store. His biographer,
Stuart, thus gives us glimpses of this busy place:</p>

<p>“Within that ‘war office,’ with its old-fashioned
‘hipped’ roof and central chimney-stack, he met his
Council of Safety during almost the entire period of the
war. Here he received commissaries and sub-commissaries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
many in number, to devise and talk over the means
of supply for our armies. From hence started, from time
to time during the war, besides those teams to which
we have just alluded, numerous other long trains of wagons,
loaded with provisions for our forces at the East,
the West, the North, and the South; and around this
spot—from the fields and farmyards of agricultural Lebanon
and its vicinity—was begun the collection of many
a herd of fat cattle, that were driven even to the far
North around Lake George and Lake Champlain, and
to the far distant banks of the Delaware and the Schuylkill,
as well as to neighboring Massachusetts and the banks
of the Hudson.</p>

<p>“Here was the point of arrival and departure for
numberless messengers and expresses that shot, in every
direction, to and from the scenes of revolutionary strife.
Narragansett ponies, of extraordinary fleetness and astonishing
endurance—worthy such governmental post-riders
as the tireless Jesse Brown, the ‘alert Samuel Hunt,’ and
the ‘flying Fessenden,’ as the latter was called—stood
hitched, we have heard, at the posts and palings around,
or by the Governor’s house, or at the dwelling of his
son-in-law Williams, ready, on any emergency of danger,
to fly with advices, in any desired direction, on the wings
of the wind. The marks of the spurs of the horsemen
thus employed were but a few years back visible within
the building—all along upon the sides of the counters
upon which they sat, waiting to receive the Governor’s
orders.</p>

<p>“So we find him during the period now under consideration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
(1775), executing in person the business of
furnishing troops, and of procuring and forwarding supplies—now
flour, particularly from Norwich; now, from
various quarters, beef and pork; now blankets; now arms;
but especially, at all times, whenever and wherever he
could procure it, powder, the manufacture of which vital
commodity he stimulated through committees appointed
to collect saltpeter in every part of the State. ‘The
necessities of the army are so great’ for this article, wrote
Washington to him almost constantly at this time, ‘that
all that can be spared should be forwarded with the
utmost expedition.’—‘Soon as your expected supply of
powder arrives,’ wrote his son-in-law, Colonel Huntington,
from Cambridge, August 14th, ‘I imagine General
Putnam will kick up a dust. He has got one floating
battery launched, and another on the stocks.’ The powder
was sent—at one time six large wagon-loads, and at
the same time two more for New York, on account of
an expected attack in that direction. ‘Our medicine-chests
will soon be exhausted,’ wrote Huntington at the
same time. The medicine-chests were replenished. And
before September Trumbull had so completely drained
his own State of the materials for war that he was obliged
to write to Washington and inform him that he could not
then afford any more.”</p>

<p>In these thrilling days the people awaited the news
upon the village green.</p>

<p>The village green of Lebanon! Across it the old
war Governor walked a thousand times to attend meetings
at the office in the interests of the State and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
welfare of man. A monument to him should arise
there.</p>

<p>The village greens of New England were fields of the
highest patriotism, and their history would be a glorious
record. The church spires rose over them; the schoolhouse
bells; and on them or in a hall near them the
folkmotes were held. These town meetings were the suggestions
of republican government and the patterns of
the great republic.</p>

<p>How the words “Brother Jonathan,” that became
the characteristic name of the nation, reached the ears
of Washington at Cambridge we do not know. It became
the nickname—the name that bespoke character to the
army through Washington. It will always live.</p>

<p>How did the people of Lebanon among the cedars
come to give that name to the great judge, assistant, and
governor that rose among them? In his official life he
was so dignified and used such strong Latin-derived words
to express his thoughts that one could hardly have suspected
a Roger de Coverley behind the courtly dressed
man and his well-weighed speech. He was an American
knight.</p>

<p>But in his private life he was as delightful as a veritable
Roger de Coverley, even if he did not fall asleep
in church. The true character of an old New Englander
was in him. He loved his neighbors as his own self with
a most generous and sympathetic love. No tale of knight-errantry
could be more charming than that of the life he
led among his own folk in Lebanon.</p>

<p>He probably studied medicine that he might doctor the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
poor. Were any poor man sick, he sent another in haste
to consult Brother Jonathan; and Brother Jonathan, in
gig, and possibly in wig, with his greatcoat in winter,
and vials, and probably snuff-box, and all, hurried to the
sick-bed.</p>

<p>He carried the medicine of medicine with him in his
heart, which was that of hope and cheer. Whatever
other doctors might say, he often said: “I have seen sicker
men than you recover; you may get well if you only look
up; it is the spiritual that heals, and the Lord is good
to all.”</p>

<p>He always asserted that the unspiritual perishes; that
that truth was not only the Bible and the sermon, but that
it was law. He had charity for all men, and he made it
the first condition of healing that one should repent of
his sins. So he prayed with the sick, and the sick people
whom he visited often found a new nature rising up within
them. The sick poor always remembered the prescriptions
of Brother Jonathan.</p>

<p>He was an astronomer and made his own almanacs.
If any one was in doubt as to what the weather was likely
to be, he went to Brother Jonathan.</p>

<p>The cattlemen and sheep-raisers came to him for advice.
Did a poor cow fall sick, she too found a friend
in Brother Jonathan.</p>

<p>He would have given away his hat off his head had it
not been a cocked one, had he found a poor man with his
head uncovered.</p>

<p>He gave his fire to those who needed it on cold days.</p>

<p>There had been established a school in Lebanon for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
the education of Indian children for missionaries. His
heart went into it; of course it did. When he was yet rich—a
merchant worth nearly $100,000 (£18,000)—he made
a subscription to schools; but when ship after ship was
lost by the stress of war and other causes, and he became
poor, he hardly knew how to pay his school subscriptions,
so he mortgaged two of his farms.</p>

<p>“I will pay my debts,” he said, “if it takes a lifetime.”
And none doubted the word of Brother Jonathan.</p>

<p>The people all pitied him when he lost his property,
and came to say that they were sorry for him when he
partly failed, and their hearts showed him a new world,
and made him love every one more than before.</p>

<p>Great thanksgivings they used to have in his perpendicular
house among the green cedars, and the stories
that were told by Madam Trumbull and her friends expressed
the very heart of old New England days.</p>

<p>What people may have been there that afterward
came to tower aloft, and some of them to move the
world! Samuel Occum may have been there, the Indian
who moved London; Brant may have been there, whose
name became a terror in the Connecticut Colony in the
Wyoming Valley, and whom the poet Campbell falsely
associates with the tragedies of Wyoming.</p>

<p>The old church stood by the green; it stands there
now. In it Governor Trumbull’s stately proclamations
were read; there probably the Declaration of Independence
was proclaimed.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving—what stories like Christmas tales of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
to-day used to be told by long log fires after the church
and the dinner, which latter exhibited all the products
of the fields and woods! A favorite story concerned
people who were frightened by ghosts that were not
ghosts.</p>

<p>Let us give one of these stories that pictures the heart
and superstition of old New England and also one of
Connecticut’s handicrafts. For the clock-cleaner was
a notable story-teller in those old days. He cleaned
family clocks and oiled them, sometimes with walnut oil.
He usually remained overnight at a farmhouse or inn,
and related stories of clocks wherever he found a clock
to clean.</p>

<p>These Connecticut clock stories in Brother Jonathan’s
day were peculiar, for clocks were supposed to be family
oracles—to stop to give warning of danger, and to stop,
as arrested by an invisible hand, on the approach of death.</p>

<p>Curious people would gather at the war office when
the wandering clock-cleaner appeared upon the green.
The time-regulator was sure to tell stories at the Alden
Tavern or at the war office, and usually at the latter.
Men with spurs would sit along the counter, and dig their
spurs into the wood, under excitement, as the clock tale
was unfolded: how that the family clock stopped and the
Nestor of the family died, and the oldest son went out
and told the bees in their straw hives.</p>

<p>Peter the outcast had an ear for these many tales while
about his work, and Dennis O’Hay was often found on
the top of a barrel at these gatherings.</p>

<p>Dennis heard these New England tales with increasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
terror. There were supposed to be fairies in the land
from which he came—fairy shoemakers, who brought
good to people and eluded their hand-grasp. He became
so filled with the “signs” and superstitions of the people
that once, when he met a white rabbit, he thought it
was a rabbit turned into a ghost, and he ran back from
the woods to the tavern to ask what the “sign” meant,
when one saw the ghost of “bunny.” A nimble little
rabbit once turned its white cotton-like tail to him, and
darted into a burrow. He ran home to ask what meant
the sign, and the good taverner said that was a sign
that he had lost the rabbit, which was usually the case
when a white tail so vanished from sight.</p>

<p>There was one story of the clock that was associated
with early revolutionary days that pictures the times as
well as superstitions vividly, and we will tell it and place
it in the war office on a long evening when the Governor
was busy with his council in the back room.</p>

<p>The clock-cleaner has come, the farmers sit on boxes
and barrels, some “cavalry” men hang over the “counter,”
and swing their feet and spurs. The candles sputter
and the light is dim, and the Connecticut clock-cleaner,
amid increasing stillness and darkness, relates his tale
slowly, which was like this:</p>


<h3>THE LIFTED LATCH</h3>

<p>An old house on the Connecticut way to Boston stood
high on the windy hill. I have ridden past it at night
when the dark savins lifted their conical forms on the
hillside by the decrepit orchards and the clouds scudded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
over the moon. It had two chimneys that seemed to
stand against the sky, and I saw it once at night when
one of those chimneys was on fire, which caused my
simple heart to beat fast in those uneventful days. I
had heard say that the minutemen stopped there on their
march from Worcester to Bunker Hill and were fed with
bread from out of the great brick oven.</p>

<p>My father told me another thing which greatly awakened
my curiosity. When the minutemen stopped there
on their march to meet the “regulars,” they were in need
of lead for bullets. They carried with them molds in
which to make bullets, but they could not obtain the
lead.</p>

<p>The good woman of the house was named Overfield,
Farmer Overfield’s wife. She was called Mis’ Overfield.
She had one daughter, a lithe, diminutive, beautiful girl,
with large blue eyes and lips winsome and red, of such
singular beauty that one’s eyes could hardly be diverted
from following her. When she had anything to say in
company, there was silence. She was the “prettiest girl
in all the country around,” people used to say. And she
was as good in these early days as she was pretty.</p>

<p>Her name was Annie—“sweet Annie Overfield”
some people named her.</p>

<p>When she saw that the minutemen were perplexed
about lead, she left her baking, wiped the meal from her
nose that had been itching as a sign “that company was
coming,” and, waving her white apron, approached the
captain and said:</p>

<p>“Captain, I could tell you where there is lead if I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
had a mind to. But what would father say if I should?
And my grandfather and grandmother, who are in their
graves—they might rise up and shake the valances o’
nights, and that would be scary, O Captain!”</p>

<p>Annie’s father came stalking in in a blue blouse, a
New England guard, ready for any duty.</p>

<p>“Father, I know where there is lead. May I tell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, girl, and the men shall have it wherever it be.
Where is it, Annie? I have no lead, else I would have
given it up at once.”</p>

<p>“In the clock weights, father.”</p>

<p>“Stop the clock!” cried the father. “Oh, Annie,
’tis a marvel you are!”</p>

<p>The old clock, with an oak frame, stood in the corner
of the “living room,” as the common room was called,
whose doors faced the parlor and the kitchen. It had
stood there for a generation. It was some eight feet
high and two broad in its upper part and two in its
lower. It had a brass ornament on the top, and it ticked
steadily and solemnly always and so loud as to be heard
in the upper rooms at night. On its face were figures
of the sun and moon. Annie’s hand had for several years
wound the clock.</p>

<p>The great clock was stopped, the heavy weights were
removed, and the minutemen carried them to the forge
of Baldwin, the blacksmith, where they were speedily
melted and poured into the molds.</p>

<p>The company went joyfully away, and as they
marched down the hill the captain ordered the men to
give three cheers for Annie Overfield. That that lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
did much for the history of our country there can be
no doubt. How much one can not tell.</p>

<p>One day, shortly after these events, a clock-cleaner
came to the house on the hill. The maple leaves were
flying and the migrating birds gathering in the rowen
meadows. He said:</p>

<p>“I can not regulate the clock now, but I will be
around again another year.”</p>

<p>When he came back, the sylph-like Annie was gone—where,
none knew. She had been gone a long time.</p>

<p>Why had she gone? It was the old tale. A common
English sailor from the provinces came to work on the
farm. He received his pay in the fall and disappeared,
and the day after he went Annie went too. It was very
mysterious. She had been “her mother’s girl.”</p>

<p>She had spent her evenings with the sailor after the
mowing days by the grindstone under the great maple-trees.
He had sung to her English sailor songs and told
her stories of the Spanish main and of his cottage at St.
John’s. He was a homely man, but merry-hearted, and
Annie had listened to him as to one enchanted. She
carried him cold drinks “right from the well” in the
field. She watched by the bars for him to come in from
the meadows and fields. She grew thin, had “crying
spells,” thought she was going “into a decline.” She was
not like herself. The love stronger than that for a mother
had found Annie amid the clover-fields when the west
winds were blowing. The common sailor had become to
her more than life. She felt that she could live better
without others than without him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>She had said to her mother one day:</p>

<p>“Malone”—the sailor’s name—“has a good heart.
I find my own in it. I wish we could give him a better
chance in life.”</p>

<p>“He is an adventurer, thrown upon the world like
a hulk of driftwood, hither and thither,” said her mother.</p>

<p>“I pity him. His heart deserves better friends than
he has found. I want to be his friend. Why may I
not?”</p>

<p>“If you were ever to marry a common sailor, Annie,
I would strew salt on your grave. I married a common
man, but he has been good to me. I have no respect
whatever for those who marry beneath them and shame
their own kin. But, Annie, that rover is worse than
a common sailor—he is a Tory; think of that—a Tory!”</p>

<p>Such was the condition of the family when the old
clock-cleaner returned.</p>

<p>He heard the story and said:</p>

<p>“I can hardly trust my ears. Annie was such a good
girl. But the heart must wed its own. I pity her. She
will come back again, for Annie is Annie.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the clock and said:</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to examine it again and see what
I can do. I will try to set it going till Annie comes
back.”</p>

<p>“I shall never take any interest in such things any
more,” said Mis’ Overfield. “It is all the same to me
whether the clock goes or stands still, or whether life goes
or stands still, for that matter. I loved Annie, and that
is what makes it so hard. She used to watch over me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
when I was sick, oh, so faithfully, but I shall never
feel the touch of her hand again, Annie’s hand. I would
weep, but I have no tears to shed. Life is all a blank
since this came upon me. The burying lot, as it looks
to me, is the pleasantest place on earth. I look out of
the pantry window sometimes and say, ‘Annie, come
back.’ Then I shut my heart. Oh, that this should
come to me!”</p>

<p>She seemed to be listening.</p>

<p>“How I used to wait for Annie evenings—conference
meeting and candle-light meeting nights and singing-school
evenings! How my heart used to beat hard when
she lifted the latch of the porch door in the night!</p>

<p>“She came home like an angel then. I wonder if
Annie’s hand will ever again lift the latch in the night.
Trouble brings the heart home and sends us back to God.
But I wouldn’t speak to her—lud, no, no, no!”</p>

<p>The tenderness went out of her face, and a strange,
foreign light came into her blue-gray eyes.</p>

<p>She sat looking fixedly toward the hill. The old
graves were there.</p>

<p>Farmer Overfield came in.</p>

<p>“Thinking?” said he.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of how Annie used to lift the latch
evenings. I wish it could be so again. But it can’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not? There can be no true life in any household
where it is forbidden to any to lift the latch.”</p>

<p>The clock-cleaner could not find the key of the clock.
It had disappeared. He pounded on the case and said:</p>

<p>“It sounds hollow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>Thanksgiving day came, and that day was supposed
to bring all of the family home.</p>

<p>Mis’ Overfield watched the people coming, and she
said to her little nurse Liddy as she waited:</p>

<p>“Have they all come, Liddy?”</p>

<p>“No, mum; not all.”</p>

<p>“Who is there to come?”</p>

<p>“Annie, mum.”</p>

<p>“She’s dead—dead here. I sometimes wish she would
come, Liddy. But I wouldn’t speak to her if she were to
come—that common sailor’s wife—and he a Tory! I
wouldn’t—would you, Liddy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mum.”</p>

<p>“You would? Tell me why now.”</p>

<p>“Because she is Annie. You would too.”</p>

<p>Mis’ Overfield gave a great sob and threw her apron
over her head, and said in a muffled voice:</p>

<p>“What made you say that, Liddy?”</p>

<p>“There may come a day when Annie can not come
back. The earth binds fast—the grave does. Think what
you might have to reflect upon.”</p>

<p>“I, Liddy—I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And there are more folks in some old houses
than one can see always. They come back. There’s
been a dead soldier here already. I saw him. And
last night I heard the latch of the back door lift up
three times.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Liddy! Nothing can ever harm us if we do
just right. It was Annie that went wrong, not I. What
do you suppose made the latch lift up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>She stood silent, then said, with sudden resolution:</p>

<p>“Liddy, you go straight to your duties and never
answer your mistress back again, not on Thanksgiving
day nor on any other day.”</p>

<p>The rooms filled. Brothers and sisters, nephews and
nieces, came, and some of the guests offered to help the
women folks about.</p>

<p>The hand of the new brass clock was moving around
toward 12. A savory odor filled the room. Little Liddy
flitted to and fro, handling hot dishes briskly so as not
to get “scalded.”</p>

<p>Those who were voluntarily helping the women folks
carried hot dishes in wrong directions. For twenty minutes
or more everything went wrong in the usual way of
the country kitchen at that hour of the day.</p>

<p>There was a jingle in the new brass clock. Then it
struck, and the farmer raised his hand, and everybody
stood still.</p>

<p>Twelve!</p>

<p>“Now, if you will all be seated at the tables,” said
Farmer Overfield, “I will supplicate a blessing.”</p>

<p>He did. Prayer has a long journey around the world
on Thanksgiving day. He arrived at last at “all who
have gone astray but are still a part of the visible creation”—his
mind wavered here—“grant ’em all repentance
and make us charitable,” he said in a lower voice.</p>

<p>The room was very still. One could almost hear the
dishes steam.</p>

<p>There was a sound in the corner of the room. The
old clock-case quivered. Farmer Overfield became nervous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
in this part of his long prayer, opened his eyes and
said:</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought I heard something somewhere. Where
was I? Liddy, she says that she heard the latch lift in
the night. I didn’t know——”</p>

<p>Just here there was a crash of dishes. Little Liddy
had seen the old clock-case shake, which caused her to lose
nerve power just as she was very carefully moving some
dishes when she thought all other eyes were shut. The
guests started.</p>

<p>“Accidents will happen,” said Farmer Overfield.
“Now, all fall to and help yourselves. It seems like old
times to find all the family here again just as it used to
be—all except Annie, Annie, Annie. Her name has not
been spoken to-day. I shall keep this plate and seat for
her here close by my side. Annie’s heart is true to me
still. I seem to feel that. I wish she were here to-day.
The true note of Thanksgiving is lacking in a broken
family. There can be no true Thanksgiving where there
is an empty chair that might be filled. I shall always
take Annie’s part. A father is always true to his daughter.
I will yet die in her arms. A daughter is the angel
for the father’s room when the great shadow falls.”</p>

<p>He stood, knife and fork in hand, the tears running
down his face.</p>

<p>There was a little shriek in the door leading to the
pantry.</p>

<p>“What now, Liddy?” asked the farmer.</p>

<p>“I saw something,” said Liddy, with shuttling eyes.</p>

<p>“What did you see, Liddy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“The sun and moon moving.”</p>

<p>“Massy! Where, Liddy?”</p>

<p>“On the face of the clock. Something is in there.
That clock comes to life sometimes,” she added, going out.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned toward the clock. Knives, forks,
and spoons were laid down, clicking on the many dishes.</p>

<p>The top of the clock, which was uncovered, seemed
animated. Some said that they could see it move, others
that the supposed movement was merely a matter of the
imagination.</p>

<p>Liddy came into the room again with more dishes.</p>

<p>“I think,” said she, “that the clock-case is haunted.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, Liddy!” said the farmer. “And what makes
you say that? Who is it that would haunt that old eight-day
clock?”</p>

<p>“One of the Britishers who was shot by a bullet made
from the lead weights. That’s my way of thinking. I’ve
known about it for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Liddy, you’re a little bit off—touched in mind—that’s
what you are, Liddy. You never was quite all
there.”</p>

<p>There arose another nervous shriek. Knives and forks
dropped.</p>

<p>“What now, Liddy?” asked the farmer. “You set
things all into agitation.”</p>

<p>The house dog joined Liddy in the new excitement.
He ran under the table and to the clock and began to
paw the case and to bark. There was a very happy, lively
tone in his bark. He then sat down and watched the
clock in a human way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>The guests waited for the farmer to speak.</p>

<p>“What did you see, Liddy?” asked Mis’ Overfield.</p>

<p>“The planets turned. Look there, now—now—there—there!”</p>

<p>The sun and moon on the clock face were indeed
agitated. The old dog gave a leap into the air and
barked more joyously than before.</p>

<p>“The valley of Ajalon!” said the farmer. “That
old timepiece is bewitched. These things are mightily
peculiarsome. I’m not inclined to be superstitious, but
what am I to think, the planets turning around in that
way? They say dogs do see apparitions first and start up.
What would Annie say if she were here now? You don’t
believe in signs, any of you, do you? I’m not superstitious,
as I said, and I say it again. But what can be
the matter with that there old clock-case? I hope that
nothing has happened to Annie. She used to wind that
clock. What do you suppose is the matter?”</p>

<p>The farmer’s eyes rolled like the planets on the clock
face.</p>

<p>“Let me go and see,” said Mis’ Overfield, rising slowly
and going toward the case, which seemed to quiver as
she advanced, supporting herself by the backs of the
chairs.</p>

<p>The nervous fancies of little Liddy could not be repressed.
She called in an atmospheric voice:</p>

<p>“Mis’ Overfield, be careful how you open that clock
door.”</p>

<p>Mis’ Overfield stopped.</p>

<p>“Why, Liddy, you distress me. The things that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
say go to my nerves. Why, Liddy, should I be afraid
to open the clock door?”</p>

<p>“Suppose, Mis’ Overfield—dare I say it—suppose
you should find a dead body there?”</p>

<p>Mis’ Overfield leaned on the back of a chair, and
Liddy added in an awesome tone:</p>

<p>“A girl’s—your own flesh and blood, Mis’ Overfield.”</p>

<p>Farmer Overfield leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>The table was as silent as though it had been bare
in an empty room.</p>

<p>The dog gave a quick, sharp bark.</p>

<p>Mis’ Overfield stood trembling.</p>

<p>“Heaven forgive me!” she said. “My heart and
Annie’s are the same. We should be good to our
own.”</p>

<p>She shook. “If I only knew that Annie was alive,
I would forgive her everything. I would take her home
to my bosom, her Tory husband and all. I never would
have one hour of peace if she were to die. I never knew
my heart before. Her cradle was here, and here should
be her last rest. Annie was a good girl, and I am blind
and hard. Annie, Annie! Oh, I would not have anything
befall Annie. Albert, where is the key of the
clock?”</p>

<p>The boy gave his mother the key.</p>

<p>“Here, mother, and it is a jolly time we’ll have.”</p>

<p>“Albert, how can you smile at a time like this! Didn’t
you hear what she suggested? Don’t you sense it? You
go with me now slowly, for I am all nerves, and my
heart is weak.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“That I will, mother.”</p>

<p>He gave her his arm and looked back with smiling
eyes on the terrified guests.</p>

<p>“Dast that boy, he knows!” cried Liddy in almost
profane excitement. “Hold up your hands. The house
is going to fall.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Liddy,” said the farmer. “All be quiet
now. We can not tell what is before us. Be still. It
seems as though I can hear the steps of Providence.
Something awaits us. I can feel it in my bones.”</p>

<p>The guests arose, and all stood silent.</p>

<p>Mis’ Overfield stopped before the clock door.</p>

<p>“Annie’s hand used to wind the clock,” she said.
“Oh, what would I give to hear her wind the clock once
more! I would be willing to lie down and give up all
to know that she was alive. Liddy’s words do so chill
me.”</p>

<p>She knocked on the clock door.</p>

<p>“Mother!”</p>

<p>The voice was the music-like tone of old. “Mother,
you will forgive me if I did marry a Tory, for Annie
is Annie—always Annie!”</p>

<p>The guests stood with intent faces.</p>

<p>The clock shook again. The old woman moved
back.</p>

<p>“That was Annie’s voice. Husband, you go and see.
If that is not Annie, then my heart is dead forever, and
I hope there may be no hereafter for me.”</p>

<p>Farmer Overfield took the keys and slowly opened
the clock door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>The guests stood with motionless eyes. The opening
door revealed at first a dress, then a hand. The old
woman threw up her arms.</p>

<p>“That’s Annie’s hand. There is no ring on it. Annie
was too poor to have a wedding-ring. Open it slowly,
husband. If she is not living, I am dead.”</p>

<p>The door was moved slowly by a trembling hand. A
form appeared.</p>

<p>“That’s Annie,” said the old woman.</p>

<p>A face. The lips parted.</p>

<p>“Father, may I come out and sit beside you in the
chair at the table?”</p>

<p>The dog whirled around with delight.</p>

<p>“Annie, my own Annie, life of my life, heart of my
heart! Annie, how came you here?” exclaimed the
farmer.</p>

<p>“I wished to see you, father, and all of my kin on
this day, and mother—poor mother——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that. I’m not worthy that you should say
that, but my hard heart is gone,” faltered Mis’ Overfield.</p>

<p>“I got Albert to prepare the clock-case so I could
stand here and move the planets around so that I could
see you through the circles made for the planets. You
can never dream how I felt here. My heart ached
to know if any one to-day would think of me, and
when you talked of me my heart made the old case
tremble.”</p>

<p>“Annie, come here,” said Farmer Overfield.</p>

<p>“But I was not invited, father. I did not intend to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
make myself known to any one but Albert. I have been
here before in the disguise of a soldier.”</p>

<p>“Annie, you are Annie, if you did marry a Tory
sailor!” and the family heart was one again.</p>

<p>The story illustrates the family feeling of the time
both as regards patriots and Tories.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>WASHINGTON SPEAKS A NAME WHICH NAMES THE REPUBLIC</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When Washington was at Cambridge his headquarters
were at the Craigie House, now known as the “home of
Longfellow,” as that poet of the world’s heart lived and
wrote there for nearly a generation. Go to Cambridge,
my young people who visit Boston, and you may see
the past of the Revolutionary days there, if you will close
your eyes to the present. The old tree is there under
which Washington took command of the army; a memorial
stone with an inscription marks the place. The old
buildings of Harvard College are there much as they
were in Washington’s days. The Episcopal church where
Washington worshiped still stands, and one may sit down
in the pew that the general-in-chief occupied as in the
Old North Church, Boston.</p>

<p>The tree under which Washington took command of
the army is decayed and is rapidly falling away. It was
once a magnificent elm, and Washington caused a lookout
to be made in the top, which overlooked Boston and the
British defenses. We can easily imagine him with his
glass, hidden among the green boughs of this lofty and
bowery tree, watching the movements of the enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Such an incident of the Revolution would seem to invite
a national picture like one of young John Trumbull’s.</p>

<p>Washington held his councils of war at the Craigie
House. It was doubtless from there that he sent his
courier flying to Jonathan Trumbull for help. His message
was that the army must have food.</p>

<p>It was then that the Connecticut Governor called together
the Committee of Public Safety and sent his men
of the secret service into the farm-ways of Connecticut
and gathered cattle and stores from the farms, and forwarded
the supplies on their way to Boston, and Dennis
O’Hay went with them.</p>

<p>Boston was to be evacuated. Where were the British
going? What was next to be done?</p>

<p>Washington called a council of his generals, and they
deliberated the question of the hour.</p>

<p>The help that had given strength to the army investing
Boston during the siege had come from Connecticut;
the great heart-beat of Jonathan Trumbull had sent the
British fleet out on the sea and away from Castle William
(now the water-park of South Boston).</p>

<p>What should be done next? Officer after officer gave
his views, without conclusion. The Brighton meadows,
afterward made famous by the pen of Longfellow, glimmered
in the light of early spring over which the happy
wings of birds were rising in song. The great trees rustled
in the spring winds. The officers paced the floor.
What was to be done next? The officers waited for Washington
to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>He had deliberated, but was not sure as to the wisest
course to pursue.</p>

<p>He lifted his face at last, and said:</p>

<p>“We will have to consult <em>Brother Jonathan</em>.”</p>

<p>The name had been used before in the army, but not
in this official way at a council.</p>

<p>It was at this council, or one like this, that he began
to impress the worth of the judgment of the Connecticut
Governor upon his generals.</p>

<p>Washington had unconsciously named the republic.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Governor’s home name began to rise
to fame.</p>

<p>These officers repeated it to others.</p>

<p>Dennis O’Hay heard it. He was told that Washington
had spoken it, probably at a council in the Craigie
House, possibly at some out-of-door consultation. However
this may be, the word had passed from the lips of the
man of destiny.</p>

<p>“Cracky,” said Dennis, using the Yankee term of
resolution, “and I will fly back to Connecticut, I will,
on the wings of me horse, and I will, and tell the Governor
of that, and I will, and all the people on the green,
and I will, and set the children to clapping their hands,
and the birds all a-singing in the green tree-tops, and
I will.”</p>

<p>Dennis leaped on his horse as with wings. He slapped
the horse’s neck with his bridle-rein and flew down the
turnpike to Norwich, and did not so much as stop to
rest at the Plainfield Tavern. That horse had the swiftness
of wings, and Dennis seemed to be a kind of centaur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>The people saw him coming, and swung their hats,
but only to say, “Who passed with the wind?”</p>

<p>The people of the cedars saw him coming up the hill
and gathered on the green to ask:</p>

<p>“What is it, Dennis?”</p>

<p>“Great news! Great news!”</p>

<p>It was a day at the brightening of spring among the
cedars. The people of the country around had heard of
Dennis’s return and they gathered upon the green, which
was growing green. The buds on the trees were swelling,
the blue air was brightening, and nature was budding
and seemed everywhere to be singing in the songs of
birds.</p>

<p>All the world was full of joy, as the people gathered
that day on the green. The Governor came out
of his war office to hear Dennis speak; the schools were
there, and William Williams, afterward a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, honored the occasion with
his presence.</p>

<p>Williams stood beside the Whig Governor under the
glowing trees.</p>

<p>Dennis came out on the green, full of honorable
pride.</p>

<p>His first words were characteristic:</p>

<p>“Oh, all ye people, all of the cedars, you well may
gather together—now. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, for it
is good news that I bring to ye all. Boston has fallen;
it has tumbled into our hands, and Castle William has
gone down into the sea, to the Britisher, and the same
will never play Yankee Doodle there any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but you should have seen him, as your brothers
and I did—General Washington. He looked as though
he had been born to lead the world. And what did he
call our Governor—now, that is what I am bursting to
tell you—what did he call our Governor?”</p>

<p>“The first patriot in America,” answered a merry
farmer.</p>

<p>“Not that, now, but something better than that.
Hear ye, open the mouths of your ears, now, and prepare
to shout; all shout. He called—so the officers all
say—he called him what you call him now. Colonel?
No, no; not that. Judge? No, no; not that. Governor?
No, no; not that. He called him what the heroes here
who ran from the fields with their guns call him; what
the good wives all call him; what the old men call him;
what the children call him; what the dogs, cats, and
all the birds call him; no, no; not that, but all nature
here catches the spirit of what we called him. He called
him <em>Brother Jonathan</em>! Shout, boys! Shout, girls!
Shout, old men! Shout all! The world will call him
that some day. My soul prophesies that. Shout, shout,
shout! with the rising sun over the cedars—all shout for
the long life and happiness of <span class="smcap">Brother Jonathan</span>!”</p>

<p>Lebanon shouted, and birds flew up from the trees
and clapped their wings, and the modest old Governor
said:</p>

<p>“I love the soul of the man who delights to bring
the people good news. I wrote to Washington, when he
took command of the army at Cambridge, these words:</p>

<p>“‘Be strong and very courageous. May the God of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
the armies of Israel shower down his blessings upon you;
may he give you wisdom and fortitude; may he cover
your head in the day of battle, and convince our enemies
of their mistake in attempting to deprive us of our liberties.’
And, my neighbors, what did he answer me? He
wrote to me, saying: ‘My confidence is in Almighty God.’
So we are brothers. And my neighbor Dennis brings good
tidings of joy out of his great heart. His heart is ours.
What will we do for such a man as Dennis O’Hay?”</p>

<p>“Make him an ensign, the ensign of the alarm-post,”
said one.</p>

<p>So Dennis O’Hay became known as Ensign Dennis
O’Hay.</p>

<p>The Governor saw that in Dennis he had a messenger
to send out on horses with wings, to bring back to Lebanon
green the tidings of the events of the war.</p>

<p>The old Governor turned aside when the shouting was
over.</p>

<p>“Dennis?”</p>

<p>“Your Honor?”</p>

<p>“You have been by the cabin of old Wetmore, the
wood-chopper of the lane.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Honor.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am afraid that the old man is a Tory. You
have heard how he turned tall Peter, his nephew, out of
doors? He said to the boy: ‘Out you go!’ The boy
came to me; my mind is taken up by the correspondences,
so I made him my clerk. I want you to put your arms
around him—for me.”</p>

<p>“Why did the old man say to the boy that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“The boy rejoiced over the Concord fight—you see!
Put your arms around him. I want you two should be
friends.”</p>

<p>“I will put my arms around him, for your sake and
for the sake of Dennis O’Hay. He shall be my heart’s
own.”</p>

<p>Peter had found friends—hearts.</p>

<p>He used to think of his old uncle as he slept under the
cedars out of doors, on guard after his duties in the store,
amid the fireflies, the night animals and birds.</p>

<p>He would seem to hear the old wood-chopper counting:</p>

<p>“One—</p>

<p>“Two—</p>

<p>“Three!”</p>

<p>He would wonder if the old man were counting for
him, or if that which was counted would go to the King.
If the patriots won their cause, the counted gold, if such
it were, could not go to the King. What were the old
man’s thoughts and purposes when he counted nights?</p>

<p>At the corner of the Trumbull house, overlooking the
hills and roads in the country of the cedars, was a passageway
that connected with the high roof. From this passageway
the approach of an enemy could be signaled by
a guard, and there was no point in the movements of the
army more important than this.</p>

<p>Governor Trumbull became recognized as a power
that stood behind the American armies. Lebanon of the
cedars was the secret capital of the colonies. Here gathered
the reserves of the war.</p>

<p>The common enemy everywhere began to plot against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the iron Governor. Spies continued to come to Lebanon in
many disguises and went away.</p>

<p>The people of Lebanon warned the Governor against
these plots and spies, but he believed in Providence; that
some good angel of protection attended him. When they
told him that his life was in constant peril, he would
say, like one who commanded hosts invisible, that “the
angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear
him.”</p>

<p>Dennis was in terror when he came to see the Governor’s
danger. He had a bed in the garret, or “cockloft,”
overlooking the cedars. From his room he watched
the roads that led up to the hill.</p>

<p>One day some men of mystery came to the war office
on horseback. Dennis saw them coming, from the garret
or upper room. He hastened to the Governor at the
war office, and gave the alarm. The men had their story,
but Dennis saw that they were spies, and thought that
they intended to return again.</p>

<p>Dennis had gained the confidence of the Governor
and of the good man’s family perfectly now. He had
become a shadow of the Governor, as it were.</p>

<p>After these mysterious men went away, the Governor
called Dennis into his war office, and said:</p>

<p>“Dennis, you know a tremendous secret, and you
warned me against these men. Why do you suspect
them?”</p>

<p>“Because a conniving man carries an air of suspicion
about him, your Honor. I can see it; I have second
sight; some folks have, your Honor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>“Dennis, you may be right. A pure heart sees clear,
and you are an honest man, else there are none. Why
do you think these men came? What was their hidden
motive?”</p>

<p>“To find out where you hid your powder, your Honor.
They are powder finders. In powder lies the hope of the
cause, Governor. I have a thing on my mind, if I have
a mind.”</p>

<p>“Well, Dennis, what have you on your mind?”</p>

<p>“There must be a military alarm-post in the cedars.
It must be connected with hiding-places all along the way
from Putnam to Norwich. And it is a man that you
can trust that you must set in charge of the same alarm-post.
As you said, I do know a tremendous secret.”</p>

<p>“You are a man that I can trust, Dennis; if not,
who?”</p>

<p>“Your Honor,” said Dennis, bowing.</p>

<p>“Your heart is as true to liberty as that of Washington
himself. To be true-hearted is the greatest thing
in the world; hearts are more than rank.”</p>

<p>“Your Honor,” said Dennis, bowing again lower,
“I would rather hear you say that than be a king.”</p>

<p>“Good, Dennis. Samuel Adams replied to the agent
of General Gage who said to him, ‘It is time for you to
make your peace with the King,’ and who then offered
him bribes: ‘I trust that I have long ago made my peace
with the King of kings, and no power on earth shall
make me recreant to my duties to my country.’”</p>

<p>“Samuel Adams is a glorious man, your Honor, and
has a heart true to your own. I would die for liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
and be willing to be forgotten for the cause. What
matters what becomes of Dennis O’Hay—but the cause,
the cause!”</p>

<p>“Then, Dennis, you are the one of all others to take
charge of the alarm-post that you propose to establish
permanently.” Many are willing to die in a cause that
would not be willing to be forgotten, the old man thought,
and walked about with his hands behind him.</p>

<p>“Forgotten, Dennis, what is it to be forgotten? The
winds of the desert blow over the Persepolis, but where
is the Persepolis? Babylon, where are thy sixty miles of
walls, and the chariots that rolled on their lofty ways?
Gone with the wind. Egypt, where are all the kings that
raised thy pyramids? Gone with the wind. Solomon,
where is thy throne of the gold and gems of the Ind?
Gone with the wind. We all shall be forgotten, or only
live in the good that we do. I like that word which you
spoke, willing to be <em>forgotten</em> for the welfare of mankind.
Dennis, I would be willing to be forgotten. I live
for the cause. I seek neither money nor fame, but only
to do the will of the everlasting God, to which I surrender
all. To live for good influence is the whole of
life. Soul value is everything. How will you establish
the alarm-post?”</p>

<p>“I will watch the roads from the top of the second
stairs as I have done before. I will have trusty men in
the cedars who will set up signal lights at night. One
of these men shall live in the rocks so that he may guard
the place where the powder is stored. He shall ride a
swift horse, and set up fire-signals at night. The secret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
shall be known to but few, if you will trust it to me
to pick my men. And Peter—nimble Peter—your trusty
clerk—who was sent out—he shall be my heart’s own.”</p>

<p>“I leave it all to you, Dennis. Establish the alarm-post.
Select you hidden men. As for me, I believe like
the men in the camp of the Hebrews, in helpers invisible.
An angel stayed the hand of Abraham, and went before
the tribes on their march out of Egypt, and led the feet
of Abraham’s servant to find Rebecca; and when the
young king was afraid to encounter so great a host, the
prophet opened his spiritual eyes, and lo! the mountain
was full of chariots and horsemen. The angel of Providence
protects me; I know it, I feel it; it is my mission
to reenforce the American army when it is in straits.
Faith walks with the heavens, and I live by faith.”</p>

<p>Dennis went out. He felt free, like one commissioned
by a higher power. Yes, he did know a tremendous
secret. He knew where the powder was hidden.</p>

<p>When he had come to share with the Governor the
secrets of collecting saltpeter and powder, he learned all
the ways of this secret service. There must be found a
place where this powder could be hidden, so as to be
safely guarded. It was a necessity.</p>

<p>Lebanon abounded in rocky hills in which were caves.
These caves could be guarded, and yet they would not
be secure against spies. Dennis began to put his Irish
wits at work to devise a way to protect a storage of
powder against spies.</p>

<p>The tall, nimble boy who had been in the service of
William Williams came first into Dennis’s mind and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
heart. Mr. Williams, for whom the boy had kept sheep,
was a graduate of Harvard College, and had been a member
of the Committee of Correspondence for the Union
and Safety of the Colonies. This man had written several
pamphlets to awaken the spirit of the colonies to
resist aggression, and the nimble boy to whom we have
referred, now the clerk, had listened at doors to the reading
of these pamphlets, and drank in the spirit of them
until he had become so full of patriotic feeling that he
thought of little but the cause.</p>

<p>Dennis’s intuitive eye fixed itself upon this boy for
secret service.</p>

<p>“Peter Nimble,” said Dennis to the young farmhand
one day, as the latter was resting under the trees
after the planting of pumpkin-seeds among the corn, while
the sheep grazed, “I have come over here to have a
secret talk with you. I have long had my eye on you.
You are full of the new fire; you see things quick; you
have long legs, and you are all brain, heart, and legs.
You are just the lad I want.”</p>

<p>“For what, Dennis?”</p>

<p>“For the secret service. Will you promise me never
to tell what I am about to tell you now?”</p>

<p>“Never, Dennis.”</p>

<p>“Though the sky fall?”</p>

<p>“Though the sky fall, and the earth cave in, and the
waters cover the land. Never, Dennis, if it be for the
cause.”</p>

<p>“It is for the cause, Peter. Hark ye, boy. We
must store powder here. Powder is the life of the war.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
We must store it in a cave, and we must have some one
to guard the cave, and to give an alarm if spies shall
come.”</p>

<p>“I can run,” said Peter.</p>

<p>“Yes, Peter, you can run, and run the right way,
too. You will never turn your heels against the country.
You can outrun all the boys. But it is not for your
heels that I come to you. I want a guard with nimble
thoughts as well as legs. You could run to me quickly
by day, as on feet of air, but it is for the night that I
want you; for a curious service, a queer service.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do?”</p>

<p>“Hold a window before your face, with a light in
the window, and stand back by the roadside in the
cedars.”</p>

<p>“That would be a strange thing for me to do, Dennis.
How would that help the cause?”</p>

<p>“You know all the people of the town. You would
know a stranger to be a stranger. Now, no stranger
can pass down the turnpike at night without a passport.
If he does, he is an enemy or a spy.</p>

<p>“You are to stand behind the lighted window at night
back in the cedars, some distance from the road. If
you see a stranger coming down the road at night, or
hear him, you are to leave the window and light on
a post and demand his passport. The window and light
at a distance will look like a house. If the traveler have
no passport, you must ask him to follow you at a distance
toward the light in the window. Hear: ‘at a distance.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“Then you are to take the window and the light and
move up the hill, by the brook ways, so that I can see
the light at the alarm-post. Then you may put out the
light, and run for the war office: run like the wind. That
will detain the spy, should he be one, and we will be
warned and thwart his design. Do you see?”</p>

<p>“I see, but am I to be stationed near a cave where
the powder is hidden?”</p>

<p>“No—tish, tish—but at a place that would turn a
night traveler from the place where the powder is concealed.
You yourself are not to know, or to seek to
know, where the powder is hidden. No, no—tish, tish.
If you were to be overpowered, you must be able to
say that you do not know where the saltpeter is. Tish,
tish!”</p>

<p>“That is a strange service, Dennis, but I will do as
you say. I will watch by the window in the heat and
cold, in the rain and snow, and I will never desert my
post.”</p>

<p>“That you will, my boy. The true heart never deserts
its post. You may save an army by this strange
service. You are no longer to be Peter Nimble, but a
window in the cedars. Ah, Peter, Peter, not in vain
did the old man send you out. Boy, the Governor likes
you, and you are my heart’s own!”</p>

<p>“But I will have to give up my place in the store?”</p>

<p>“I will talk with the Governor about that.”</p>

<p>One day Dennis O’Hay stood by the high window,
looking down the turnpike road. A horseman seemed
to leap on his flying steed into the way. Dennis ran down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the stairs to give an alarm, and found the Governor in
the great room, thinking as always.</p>

<p>“A man is coming on horseback, riding like mad.
He looks like a general.”</p>

<p>“Spencer—I am expecting him—I sent for him. Sit
down; your presence may make a clearer atmosphere.”</p>

<p>Dennis did not comprehend the Governor, but his
curiosity was excited, and he sat down by the stairway.</p>

<p>A horse dashed up to the door. A man in uniform
knocked, and entered with little ceremony.</p>

<p>“Governor, I am dishonored. Let me say at once
that I am about to resign my commission in the army.”</p>

<p>“You have been superseded by General Putnam.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I who offered my life and all in the north in
the service of my country, have been superseded. Congress
little esteems such service as mine. Governor, I
am undone.”</p>

<p>“General Spencer, Congress is seeking to place the
best leaders in the field. It has done so now. It has not
dishonored you; it honors you; it wants your service
under Putnam.”</p>

<p>“Under! You may well say under. Would you, with
a record like mine, serve <em>under</em> any man?”</p>

<p>“I would. My only thought is for the good of the
people and the success of the cause. I have given up
making money, for the cause. I have given up seeking
position of popularity, for the cause. I am seeking to
be neither a general, nor a congressman, nor a diplomat,
for the cause. Whatever a man be or have, his influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
is all that he is. I would do anything that would
tend to make my influence powerful for the cause. I
have snuffed out ambition, for the cause.”</p>

<p>General Spencer dropped his hands on his knees.</p>

<p>“Governor Trumbull, what would you have me
do?”</p>

<p>“Serve your country under Putnam—as Congress
wills—and never hinder the cause by any personal consideration.
Be the cause.”</p>

<p>“Governor, I will; for your sake, I will. I see my
way clear. I was not myself when I came—I am myself
now.”</p>

<p>“Not for my sake, General, but for the cause!”</p>

<p>Dennis had seen the Governor’s soul. Giant that he
was, tears ran down his face. He went out into the
open air.</p>

<p>It was evening at Lebanon. He looked up to the hills
and saw the clerk, who had again become a shepherd-boy,
there in the dusk guiding the sheep to sheltered pastures
among the savins.</p>

<p>Dennis was lonesome for companionship. He was but
a common laborer, with no family or fortune, nothing but
his honest soul.</p>

<p>He longed to talk with one like himself. He walked
up the hills, and hailed the shepherd-boy, who had become
a guard in the new secret service.</p>

<p>“Nimble,” he said, “you believe in the Governor,
don’t you? I do, more and more.”</p>

<p>“’Fore the Lord, I do,” said the shepherd in an awesome
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“I have just seen the soul of that man. He is more
of a god than a man. But, Nimble, Nimble, my heart’s
own boy, he is surrounded more and more by spies, and
think of it, wagons of powder are coming here and going
away. What havoc a spy could make!</p>

<p>“Boy, my heart goes out to that man. I would die
for him. So would you. I am going to act as a guard
for him, not only openly—I do that now—but secretly.
You will act with me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Dennis. But what more can I do?”</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open on the hills against surprise,
and guard the magazines.”</p>

<p>“That I am doing, but where are the magazines?”</p>

<p>“Where are the magazines?”</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, boy, do not seek to know. Tish, tish!
Have an eye on the covered ways that are still. You
watch nights by <em>the window</em>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I can watch days.”</p>

<p>The sheep lay down in the sheltered ways of the high
hill, and the two talked together as brothers. They had
become a part of the cause.</p>

<p>And Dennis found in his heart a new and unexpected
delight. It was when he said to the shepherd-boy of the
green cedars, as he did almost daily, “You are my heart’s
own; we serve one cause, and look for nothing more!”</p>

<p>So these two patriots became to Brother Jonathan
“helpers invisible.”</p>

<p>The Governor now hurried levies. Lebanon was a
scene of excitement. Connecticut forgot her own perils,
for the greater need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>Dennis was ordered away with the men. He was to
drive a powder-wagon. The young shepherd was to leave
for a time his place as a watchman and to go with him.</p>

<p>In the midst of these preparations a beautiful, anxious
face flitted to and fro. It was that of Madam Trumbull.</p>

<p>“You must not go,” said she to Dennis. “We need
you here.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“I—spies swarm; the Governor is all of the time in
peril. I can trust your heart.”</p>

<p>“He must go,” said the Governor. “The powder-wagon
needs him more than I do. I shall be guarded.
I can hear the wings; the rocks of Lebanon are not
firmer than my faith. Powder is the battle. Go, Dennis,
go. Our powder told at Bunker Hill; they will need it
again.”</p>

<p>Dennis and the shepherd-boy went, guarding the
powder.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Governor,” said Dennis. “We leave the
heavens behind us still.”</p>

<p>What a time that was! Every Whig forgot his own
self and interests in the cause. No one looked for any
pay for anything. The cattle, the sheep, the corn and
grain, all belonged to the cause. Everything followed the
suggestion of the great Governor’s heart.</p>

<p>Tories and spies came to Lebanon with plots in their
hearts, but they went away again. Ships down the river
landed men, who came to Lebanon with evil intents; but
they looked at the Governor from the tavern window,
as he crossed the green, and went away again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>The school for the training of Indian missionaries,
that had been founded in Lebanon and that had trained
Occum, who became the marvelous Indian preacher, had
been removed to a log-house college on the upper Connecticut
now, where it was to become Dartmouth College.
But Indians still came to the green, and heard the cannon
thunder with wonder.</p>

<p>The Governor’s house, the alarm-post, was to become
the head of a long line of signal-stations.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>PETER NIMBLE AND DENNIS IN THE ALARM-POST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Peter, after being entrusted with Dennis’s secret of
the hidden powder, walked about like one whose head was
in the air. If he stuck pumpkin-seeds into corn-hills, he
did so with a machine-like motion. He had listened to
the singing of the birds in the cedars, but he forgot the
bird-singing now; though he loved rare wild flowers, a
white orchid bloomed among the wintergreens by the ferny
brookside, but he did not see it now; the sky, the forests,
and everything seemed to have vanished away.</p>

<p>He watched Dennis after their return as the latter
came out of the alarm-post over the way and went to the
tavern or the war office.</p>

<p>Dennis for a time merely bowed to him and passed
him by, day by day, when on duty; and the corn grew,
and the orioles flamed in the air. But one thought held
him—a picture of the light in the window in the cedars,
guarding some unknown cave that contained the lightnings
and the thunder of the battle-field. What would
come of that service?</p>

<p>He at last felt that he must see Dennis. He could
stand the suspense no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>So one night he crept up to Dennis’s chamber under
the rafters.</p>

<p>“I could stay away from you no longer, after what
you told me,” said he. “Strange things are going on—horsemen
coming and going; queer people haunt the Colchester
road; knife-grinders, clock-cleaners, going into the
forest to get walnut-oil; men calling out ‘Old brass to
mend’; and I seem to see spies in them, and I fear for
<em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>“Boy, I fear for him. He is an old man now, but
he walks erect, and seems to think that some host unseen
is guarding him. He wears the armor of faith. I can
see it, other people do not; and he does not fear the
face of clay.”</p>

<p>“Dennis, when are you going to set me behind the
window and the light in the cedars, at night?”</p>

<p>“Soon, boy, soon. Let us look out of the window.”</p>

<p>It was a June night. Below them was the war office,
the Alden Tavern, the house of William Williams—the
boy’s home. Afar stretched the intervales, now full of
fireflies and glowing with the silvery light of the half-moon.
Night-hawks made lively the still air, and the
lonely notes of the whippoorwills rang out from the
cedars and savins in nature’s own sad cadences. The
roads were full of the odors of wild roses and sweetbrier,
but were silent.</p>

<p>“Dennis,” said Peter, “I have been thinking. Suppose
I were to watch in the cedars, and an unknown man
were to come down the open road toward the light in the
window. And suppose I were to say, ‘Halt, and give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
the countersign,’ and he were to have no countersign.
Then I would say, ‘Follow me, but do not come near
me, or I will discharge my duty upon you.’ And suppose
he were to follow, and I move back, back, back with
the window and light, and he were to think that I were
a house, and that I were to draw him into a trap and
lose him, and put out the light and run for you—what
would you do then?”</p>

<p>“I would hunt for him in the ravine where you left
him—in the wood trap—and would find him, and wring
from him the cause of his being on the highway without
a passport.”</p>

<p>“Dennis, do you think that such a thing as that will
ever happen?”</p>

<p>“Yes; my instincts tell me that it will. Boy, there
is one man whom Washington trusts, whom the Governor
relies upon, but in whom I can see a false heart. He was
born only a few miles from here. He is famous. If he
were to turn traitor to our cause, as I believe he will,
he would send spies to Lebanon. He would seek to destroy
the hiding-places of powder, and he knows where
they are to be found. Then, boy, your time to thwart
such designs would come.”</p>

<p>“What is that man’s name?”</p>

<p>“I hardly dare to breathe it even to you, with a heart
of truth.”</p>

<p>“I will never break your confidence. What is the
name?”</p>

<p>“Benedict Arnold!”</p>

<p>It now began to be seen in the army that the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
was in peril. The Tories plotted a secret warfare
against the leading patriots.</p>

<p>One day Governor Trumbull met the Council of Public
Safety with the alarming declaration:</p>

<p>“They have put a price upon my head.”</p>

<p>A reward had been secretly offered for his capture.</p>

<p>“I must have a guard,” he said, and a guard was
granted him of four sturdy, loyal men—a public guard,
who examined all strangers who came by day to Lebanon.</p>

<p>The plots of the Tories filled the country with alarm.
One of these plots was to assassinate Washington. Others
were to abduct the royal Governors.</p>

<p>These plotters tried to seize Governor Clinton of New
York, and William Livingston, the patriotic Governor
of New Jersey. They did seize General Stillman at
Fairfield and carried him away as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Lebanon was exposed to such incursions from the sea.
Spy boats were on the waters, and these might land men
on the highway to Lebanon and seize the Governor and
bear him away.</p>

<p>The biographer of Governor Trumbull (Stuart) thus
relates an incident that illustrates the perils to which
the Governor was exposed:</p>

<p>“A traveler, in the garb of a mendicant—of exceedingly
suspicious appearance—came into his house one
evening when he was unwell and had retired to bed.
The stranger, though denied the opportunity of seeing
him, yet insisted upon an interview so pertinaciously that
at last the Governor’s wary housekeeper—Mrs. Hyde—alarmed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
and disgusted at his conduct, seized the shovel
and tongs from the fireplace and drove him out of the
house. At the same time she called loudly for the guard;
but the intruder suddenly disappeared, and, though careful
search was made, eluded pursuit, and never appeared
in that quarter again.”</p>

<p>One of the reasons that made Lebanon a perilous place
and that invited plots and spies was that magazines of
powder from the West Indies were thought to be hidden
here, as well as at New London and along the Connecticut
main and river. Powder was the necessity of the
war; to explode a powder magazine was to retard the
cause.</p>

<p>Lebanon was like a secret fortress to the cause. Prisoners
of war were sent to Governor Trumbull. It was
thought that they could not be rescued here. But their
detention here by the wise, firm Governor invited new
plots. The thirteen colonies sent their State prisoners
here. Among these prisoners was the Tory son of Benjamin
Franklin, a disgrace to the great patriot, that led him
to carry a heavy heart amid all of his honors as the
ambassador to the French court. Dr. Benjamin Church,
a classmate of Trumbull at college, was sent to him among
these prisoners.</p>

<p>Trumbull became universally hated by the Tories.
They saw in him the silent captain of the world’s movement
for liberty. The condition became so alarming that
in November, 1779, Washington sent a message to him
to seize all Tories. “They are preying upon the vitals
of the country,” he said. The Continental Congress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
demanded of him to “arrest every person that endangered
the safety of the colony.” The condition that became
so alarming, then, was beginning now.</p>

<p>What a position was that that was held by this brave,
clear-headed, conscience-free man!</p>

<p>Strangers were coming and going; any one of them
might have a cunning plot against the Governor in his
heart. The way to him was easy. Express-wagons with
provisions started from Lebanon; drivers of cattle came
there; people who had cases of casuistry; men desiring
public appointment in the army; peddlers, wayfarers,
seamen, the captains of privateers.</p>

<p>But he walked among them—amid these accumulating
perils—as one who had a “guard invisible.” He had.
He knew that his own people were loyal to him, that
they believed him as one directed by the Supreme
Power for the supreme good, and that they loved him
as a father.</p>

<p>Dennis guarded the good old man as though he had
had a commission from the skies to do so. He gave to
him the strength of his great heart. He caused a tower—“the
alarm-post”—over his head, one secret room, to
protect him—“a room over the gate”—and the room
must have seemed to the man whose brain directed all
like the outstretched wing of a guardian divine. The
Governor was an old man when the war began. Born
in 1710, he was at the time of the Declaration of Independence
sixty-six years old.</p>

<p>Dennis was like a guardian sent to him, and Peter
like a messenger sent to Dennis. There was something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
in the glances of each to the other that was out of the
common of life—it was the cause.</p>

<p>One day there was a shout in the alarm-post.</p>

<p>A man was riding up the Colchester road, dashing,
as it were, as if his own body and that of his horse were
only agents of this thought. He was an Irishman. When
the Lexington alarm came, he had heard the clock of
liberty strike; his hour had come.</p>

<p>“A man is coming like mad, riding with the wind,”
said the sentinel in common terms.</p>

<p>The man came rushing up to the store, and drew
his rein. The Governor met him there.</p>

<p>“Knox, your Honor, Knox of the artillery. I was
at Bunker Hill.”</p>

<p>“I know you by your good name,” said the Governor.
“You know how to put your shoulder to the wheel.”</p>

<p>Knox of the artillery smiled.</p>

<p>He had won the reputation of knowing how to put
his shoulder to the wheel in a queer way. There was a
rivalry between the Northenders and Southenders in
Boston, and both parties celebrated Guy Fawkes’s day
with grotesque processions, in which were effigies of Guy
Fawkes and the devil. In an evening procession of the
party to which young Knox belonged on Guy Fawkes’s
day the wheel of the wagon or float bearing an effigy,
possibly of Guy Fawkes, broke, and that the rival party
might not know it and ridicule his party, he said:</p>

<p>“I will put my shoulder to the wheel.”</p>

<p>He did this, and the float moved on, and the pride
of his party was saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>Knox of the artillery had kept a bookstore in Boston.
It was like the New Corner Bookstore before the famous
Old Corner Bookstore. When the war broke out he
was attached to the artillery. There was a great need
of powder, and he had a scent for it. He found it, he
hid it; he was the “powder-monkey” of the great campaigns.</p>

<p>Like Paul Revere, he caught the spirit of the minutemen.
He could ride for liberty! He was riding for
liberty now!</p>

<p>“Washington recommended you to volunteer for the
artillery service,” said the Governor. “I could have no
more favorable introduction to you. You do not ride
for nothing, my young friend. May I ask what brings
you here? Your horse foams.”</p>

<p>“There is no time to be lost in days like these,” said
the young artilleryman. “These are days of destiny, and
we must make the success of our cause sure. I went to
Washington for permission to bring the siege-guns and
powder from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston. I have come
to you for a like reason. I am sure, in my soul, of
ultimate victory; I know it will come, but preparation
is victory. Boston is evacuated, and to defend New York
we must protect the coast of Connecticut. I have conferred
with Washington, and I must have a word with
you.”</p>

<p>“To the tavern with the horse,” said the Governor.
“Into the store, or war office, as I call my place here,
we will go and shut the weather-door, and I will answer
‘Go’ if any call. We will consider the matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>They went into the store and the door was shut.</p>

<p>Without sighed the cedars in the April or May winds.
It was the coming of summer; the bright wings of southern
birds were blooming in the air. The cedars were
dressing in green, and the elms flaming in the glowing
suns of the long days.</p>

<p>They talked, as we may fancy, of the sons of liberty,
the siege of Boston, and the outlook, and here young
Knox gained strength to face the strenuous campaigns
of New York and the Jerseys, and to cause the cannon
of liberty to thunder as never before.</p>

<p>They talked of Rhode Island. Strange things were
happening there.</p>

<p>Then the Committee of Safety came. And they considered
the matter.</p>

<p>The Governor had a habit of saying, “Let us consider
the matter”; after a time he added, “and bring
it before the council.”</p>

<p>He walked about like a visitor to the world. He was
always “considering” some matter.</p>

<p>He would stand before the church, considering; cross
the green, considering; the public men who came to visit
him usually found him considering.</p>

<p>Why had Knox come to Lebanon?</p>

<p>It was to talk of powder. How could saltpeter be
found? Where could it be stored?</p>

<p>There might be a powder magazine at New London,
or near it, or in covert in a place on the Connecticut,
or right here among the rocky caves of the hills. Where?</p>

<p>The Governor would “consider.” He did, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
secret hiding-places of powder were known to few besides
him. The Governor knew the guards of the magazines.
So Connecticut stored powder.</p>

<p>“Powder, powder, ye gods, send us powder!” cried
General Putnam at <a href="#i_fp129">the battle of Bunker Hill</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp129">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_132">The battle of Bunker Hill.</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There was a powder famine. The whole army needed
powder.</p>

<p>One day the Governor sat before his door on the
green, waiting the return of Dennis. The latter came
back from a commission which he had executed quickly,
and dropped from his horse on the green.</p>

<p>“You have made short time, Dennis.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Governor; I never think of myself, but only
of the cause.”</p>

<p>“You may well say that, and I know it to be true.
Such a spirit as that in these testing times is invaluable.
I have a new commission for you.”</p>

<p>“Let me have it. I will die for it; I am in for liberty
now—head, heart, and heels.”</p>

<p>He sunk down on the green.</p>

<p>“Let us consider,” the Governor said; “let us consider.
You have heard me speak of Salisbury, the hidden town
in the northwest corner of the State, on the Housatonic.
The world knows little of that town, but it hears much.
There has been a foundry there since ’62. I am going
to make an arsenal there, and manufacture guns there,
and make it a powder-post. I must have post-riders who
can lead teamsters and who can be trusted, and move
quickly, to go from Lebanon green to Salisbury with my
orders. No spot in America can be made more useful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
to our army than this. I am going to appoint you as
an officer for this business, as a special messenger to
Salisbury in the secret service.</p>

<p>“Dennis, no one can do so much as when he is doing
many things. When I am doing two things well, I can
do three. I never undertake anything that I can not do
well, but experience enables us to do many things well,
as you are learning yourself, Dennis O’Hay.”</p>

<p>Dennis bowed.</p>

<p>Salisbury was a hidden place, but rich in nature. It
was a place of iron-mines, with limestone and granite at
the foot of the mountains. Here the United States began
to cast cannon and gather saltpeter. The works
grew. Cannon-balls, bombs, shells, grape-shot, anchors,
hand-grenades, swivels, mess-pots and kettles, all implements
of war were made and stored here. The armaments
of ships were furnished here by skilled hands. Here
the furnaces blazed night and day. Here the ore-diggers,
founders, molders, and guards were constantly at work.
There came here an army of teamsters for transportation.
The Governor wished one whom he could trust to bear his
orders to this town hidden among the mountains, and
Dennis was such a man. Dennis could be spared, as there
was a regular guard at the alarm-post now, and the church
afforded it a shelter.</p>

<p>The reader who makes a pilgrimage to Lebanon to
visit the “war office” should note the old church and
recall the habits of a stately past, when men lived less for
money-making and more for the things that live.</p>

<p>The solemn bell rings out as of old, but it is over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
graves of people who were the empire builders, but who
knew it not except by faith. The gray stones are crumbling
where they lie. The engine-whistle sounds afar,
and Willimantic reflects the life of new times. Here New
England of old lives on—apart from the hurrying world
of steam and electricity.</p>

<p>The great cedars are gone, though cedar swamps are
near. Night settles down over all in silence, and one
feels here that this is a lonely world.</p>

<p>The lights have gone out in the old Alden Tavern,
and the tavern itself is gone, but nature here is beautiful
among the hills, and to the susceptible eye the hills are
touched by the spirit of the patriots of old.</p>

<small>A MAN WITH A CANE—“OFF WITH YOUR HAT”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dennis O’Hay, who had created for the cause the
alarm-post in the cedars, learned all the ways and byways
of the Connecticut colonies, and the ways leading to
and out of Boston. He was, as we have said, a giant in
form, and his usual salutation—“The top of the morning
to everybody,” or “The top of the morning to everybody
on this green earth”—won the hearts of people, and
as much by the tone in which it was spoken as by the
whole-hearted expression itself. He came to be known
as the Irish giant of the hill country.</p>

<p>He traveled much in the secret service from Lebanon
to Plainfield and Providence, which was a part of the turnpike
road to Norwich. The children and dogs seemed to
know him, and the very geese along the way to salute him
with honks of wonder quite uncommon.</p>

<p>He greeted titled people and laborers in the same
common way, and he one day said to the Governor:</p>

<p>“If I were to meet General Prescott himself, I would
not take off my hat to him unless he met me civil.”</p>

<p>Who was General Prescott? Not the patriot hero
of Bunker Hill. He was a British general that had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
sent to Rhode Island, and had made himself a terror
there. The women, children, dogs, and perhaps the farmhouse
geese, ran <em>from</em> him when he appeared; even the
Rhode Island Quakers moved aside when he was seen in a
highway.</p>

<p>He carried a cane.</p>

<p>When he met a person in the highway he used to
say:</p>

<p>“Off with your hat! Don’t you know who I am?”</p>

<p>If the person so accosted did not doff his hat, the
pompous General gave the hat a vigorous whack with his
stout cane, and the wearer’s head rung, and the latter
did not soon again forget his manners.</p>

<p>He once met an aged Quaker on the way—and these
incidents are largely traditional—who approached him
respectfully, after the usual way, with his broad-brimmed
hat covering his curly locks.</p>

<p>“Yea, verily, one day outshines another, and to goodly
people this is a goodly world.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said the testy General.</p>

<p>“A servant of the Lord, as I hope.”</p>

<p>“A servant of the Lord? Off with your hat! Haven’t
you any reverence for me, nor the Lord either? Don’t
you know who <em>I</em> am?”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, softly; speak not thus, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Off with your hat!” said the irate General. “None
of your yea says and nay says in my presence.”</p>

<p>“I never unhat or unbonnet, my friend, in the presence
of any man. I could not do it if I were to meet
the King himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>The General grew red in the face.</p>

<p>“There, you Pharisee, take that,” and here he applied
his cane to the good Quaker’s hat, “and that, and
<em>that</em>, and <span class="allsmcap">THAT</span>!”</p>

<p>The Quaker strode away, and would need a new hat
when next he went abroad on the highway of the orchards
and gardens.</p>

<p>General Prescott, while at Newport, desired to have
a sidewalk in front of his house, so he ordered all of
his neighbors’ door-stones to be removed for the purpose.</p>

<p>He was a petty tyrant, and he liked nothing so much
as to make the people—“rebels,” as he called them—feel
his power. He would order any one whom he disliked
to be sent to the military prison without assigning
any reason.</p>

<p>He once sent a greatly respected citizen to prison and
forbade that the latter should have any verbal communication
with his friends or family. The wife of the prisoner
used to send him notes in loaves of bread.</p>

<p>One day she appeared before Prescott, and desired
him to allow her to make one visit to her husband.</p>

<p>“Who do you think I am?” said the General, or
words in this spirit. “Instead of allowing you to visit
him, I will have him hanged before the end of the week.”</p>

<p>Under the petty tyranny of Prescott no one seemed
safe on the island.</p>

<p>The stories of Prescott’s insults to worthy people
roused the spirit of Dennis.</p>

<p>“An’ sure it is, now,” he said to the Governor, “if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
I were to meet that big-feeling Britisher, I would make
him take off his own hat. Look at me now.”</p>

<p>Dennis stretched himself up to a height of nearly
seven feet.</p>

<p>“If he sassed me back, I’d give him one box on the
ear with this shovel of a hand, and he would never speak
one word after he felt its swoop; and it will be a sorry
day if he ever says ‘Off with your hat’ to me, now!”</p>

<p>He repeated these things to Peter on the green.</p>

<p>Dennis had met a man in Providence by the name
of Barton—Colonel Barton. This man was a native of
Warren, R. I., and the son of a thrifty farmer who
owned a beautiful estate on Touisset Neck. The farm
and the family burying-ground are still to be seen there,
much as they were in the Revolutionary days. The place
is now owned by Elmer Cole.</p>

<p>Barton was a brave, bold man. He conceived a plan to
capture the tyrannical Prescott and humiliate the testy
Britisher. For this enterprise he desired to enlist strong,
fearless, seafaring men.</p>

<p>He had met Dennis and had said to himself that he
must have the rugged Irishman’s assistance.</p>

<p>He met Dennis again one day in Providence.</p>

<p>“Dennis O’Hay, can you keep a secret?”</p>

<p>“Sure I can, if anybody. Dennis O’Hay would not
betray a secret if the earth were to quake and the heavens
were all to come tumbling down, sure as you are living—never
that would Dennis O’Hay.”</p>

<p>“Then close your mouth and open your ears. I have
a plan to capture General Prescott.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“An’ I am with ye. I’ll like to make that man feel
the wake of my two fists, and he wouldn’t dare to cane
me after that.”</p>

<p>“I want to secure twenty men or more that I can
trust, seafaring men. You must be one of them,” he
continued.</p>

<p>“I plan to go down to Warwick Neck, and to go over
to the island with my picked men in the night on whale-boats.
The General and his guard are at the Overing
House on the north end of the island, down by the sea.</p>

<p>“I plan to pass through the British fleet in the night
with muffled oars, to land near Prescott’s headquarters,
and——”</p>

<p>“Whoop!” said Dennis rudely, “to carry him off
before he has time to put on his clothes. You hand
him over to me, and I would get him back down to the
boats as easy as a chicken-hawk with a chicken. He
would not even ask me to take off my hat. Put me down
as one of the picked men.”</p>

<p>“You will meet me at the wharf on Warwick Neck
on the afternoon of July 10th.”</p>

<p>“That I will. You are a brave man and have the
spirit of the times. That man will know what are the
rights of men if I ever get him between these two fists.
What did Providence make these hands for?”</p>

<p>Dennis opened them and swung them around like a
windmill.</p>

<p>Dennis hurried back to Lebanon. He found the Governor
there, and said:</p>

<p>“I am going on an adventure with Colonel Barton;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
and when I return perhaps I will bring a stranger with
me. Mum is the word, your Honor.”</p>

<p>“Barton, who is he?” asked the Governor.</p>

<p>“A man with a stout heart, who can see in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Go, Dennis, I have confidence in you.”</p>

<p>Then Dennis went to Peter. He did not tell him the
plot, not all of it, but he said:</p>

<p>“I am going to attempt something that will tip over
the world. I want you to watch for my coming back.
I will signal to you from the Plainfield Hills, and when
you see the signal, run to the Governor and say: ‘They’ve
got him!’ Oh, Peter, it is a foine lad that you are now.”
Dennis slapped both hands on his knees, and laughed in
a strange way.</p>

<p>When the evening of the 10th of July came and
Warwick Point, with its green sea meadows and great
trees, faded in the long cloudy twilight, off the new
wharfage lay three whale-boats, strong ribbed, and ample
enough to hold immense storage of blubber.</p>

<p>In the shadows of the waving trees were Colonel
Barton and some forty men. The old ballad says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas on that dark and stormy night,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Went down upon the shore.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There were more than twenty men who gathered at
Warwick Point on that eventful evening.</p>

<p>It had been a windy day, a July storm, and the bay,
usually so blue and placid, was ruffled.</p>

<p>Dennis was on hand at the appointed hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“This is a good night for our enterprise,” said Barton.
“This is a night of darkness, and it favors us; let it be
one of silence.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” said Dennis. “Oh, General Prescott,
how I long to fold you in my arms and give you a pat,
pat on your face!”</p>

<p>“Stop your joking,” said Barton. “We face serious
work now.”</p>

<p>Darkness fell on the waters. The men were mostly
sailors, or used to seafaring life.</p>

<p>They heard the boom of the sunset gun from the
British war-ships lying between them and Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The boats started toward Rhode Island in the darkness
with silent men and muffled oars.</p>

<p>They passed between the ships that were guarding the
British camp.</p>

<p>“All is well,” called a sentinel on one of the ships
whose lights glimmered in the mist.</p>

<p>“Much you know about it,” said Dennis.</p>

<p>“Silence!” said Barton, as the oars dipped in the
waters in which lay the cloud.</p>

<p>As silent as sea-birds and as unseen as birds in the
cloud the boats passed on and reached the shores of
Rhode Island, beyond the two islands of Prudence and
Patience.</p>

<p>There were lights in the Overing House. They glimmered
in the mist through the wet and dripping trees.</p>

<p>The clouds were breaking and the moon was rolling
through them.</p>

<p>Barton summoned to him four trusty men. Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
them was the giant Dennis, and a powerful negro called
Sile Sisson.</p>

<p>This party stole through the side ways to the house.</p>

<p>A guard was there.</p>

<p>“Halt and give the countersign!” said the sentinel.</p>

<p>“We need no countersign,” said the leader. “Are
there any deserters here?”</p>

<p>The sentinel was thrown off his guard.</p>

<p>Suddenly he found his gun wrenched from him, and
he himself, poor man, in the hands of the giant Dennis.
He was greatly astonished.</p>

<p>Colonel Barton entered the house, and found Mr.
Overton, a Quaker, reading in one of the lower rooms.</p>

<p>“Is General Prescott here?” asked Colonel Barton.</p>

<p>The Quaker’s eyes rounded.</p>

<p>“He has retired.”</p>

<p>“Where is his room?”</p>

<p>“At the head of the stairs.”</p>

<p>Colonel Barton ascended the stairs and stood before
Prescott’s door.</p>

<p>He gave a startling rap.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>He tried the door. It was locked. He endeavored to
force open the door, but it was firm.</p>

<p>“I will open the door,” said the giant negro. “Stand
back.”</p>

<p>His head was like a battering ram. He drew back,
bent forward, and struck the door with the top of his
head.</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>An old gentleman jumped out of bed, all astonished
and excited.</p>

<p>“Thieves! help!” cried the terrified man; but the
sentry was in charge of Dennis.</p>

<p>Colonel Barton laid his hand on General Prescott’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“General Prescott, you are my prisoner, and you
must go immediately to my boats.”</p>

<p>“The dragon I am! Give me time to dress.”</p>

<p>“No, you can have no time to dress. I will take your
clothes with you; march right on, just as you are.”</p>

<p>The proud General was pushed down-stairs, greatly
to the amazement of the good Quaker, Mr. Overton, and
was led out into fields which were full of briers, partly
naked as he was. He was so filled with terror that he
did not greatly mind the briers. He was hurried over
the rough ways, gasping and trembling, and found himself
on a whale-boat, with two other boats near him.
The three boats moved away.</p>

<p>“All is well!” said the sentinels on the ships.</p>

<p>The noon of night passed, the clouds scudding over
the moon; and the silent boats, amid the British assurances
that all was well, landed near Providence, and
horses with couriers ran hither and thither to carry the
news that Colonel Barton had captured General Prescott.</p>

<p>It was decided to send Prescott to Washington’s headquarters,
and he would pass through Lebanon.</p>

<p>Dennis rode swiftly toward Lebanon to tell the people
the great news. He raised the signal at Plainfield, and
Peter ran to the Governor’s office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Raree show! raree show!” shouted Dennis as he
entered the town, and met the open-mouthed people on
the green. “Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be
glad, and all good people shout now. Colonel Barton
has captured General Prescott, and they are bringing him
here!”</p>

<p>General Prescott, with his spirit unbroken, was
brought to Lebanon. The carriage in which he was held
as a prisoner rolled up to the door of the old Alden
Tavern, and Prescott was led into the office.</p>

<p>“I must have something to eat,” said Prescott.</p>

<p>The good woman of the tavern bustled about, and
brought out her bean-pot and set it down on the dining-table.
She had stewed corn, too, and of the two one might
make the old-time luxury called succotash.</p>

<p>The beans and corn steamed, and the good woman,
loyal as she was, was glad that she could present so fine
a supper to such a notable man.</p>

<p>But General Prescott had been used to the dining-halls
of castles.</p>

<p>“Do you call that a supper?” said he angrily. “It
is not fit for hogs to eat. Take it away!”</p>

<p>Dennis had come upon the scene.</p>

<p>“Take it away!” demanded Prescott haughtily.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you away for insulting my wife,” said the
tavern-keeper. “Dennis, take down the cowhide and I
will make this Britisher dance.”</p>

<p>The tavern-keeper applied the cowhide to the leaping
General as an old-fashioned schoolmaster might have used
a birch switch on an unruly boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>It was a terrible chastisement that the General
received, and he always remembered it. One day,
in the course of the war, after he had been exchanged
for General Lee, he met a man who looked like the
tavern-keeper, and he shrunk back in alarm and said:
“Oh, but I thought that was the man who cowhided
me.”</p>

<p>These incidents are mainly true, and have but a thread
of fiction.</p>

<p>Dennis became a local hero among the friends of
Brother Jonathan, and took his place as the keeper of
the alarm-post again.</p>

<p>“Dennis,” said the Governor to him one day, “our
hearts are one; I can trust you anywhere. I will have
important service for you some day. When there shall
come some great emergency, I will know whom I can
trust. General Washington trusts me, and I can trust
you.”</p>

<p>What a compliment! Dennis threw up his arms, and
leaped.</p>

<p>“I feel as though I could shake the heavens now.
After General Washington, you, and after you—hurrah
for Dennis O’Hay! I wish my old mother in Ireland
could hear that, now. You shall never trust the heart
of Dennis O’Hay to your sorrow. These times make
men, and one does not get acquainted with himself until
he is tried.”</p>

<p>Dennis had grown. He felt that something noble in
the secret service awaited him. If he could not make
himself famous, he could be a cause of success in others.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
That he would be, and this sense of manhood filled his
ambition.</p>

<p>“It is only a matter of time,” he said, “between
Shakespeare and the King and Dennis O’Hay. We will
all go into oblivion at last, like the kings of the pyramids
of Egypt. It is only what we do that lasts.”</p>

<p>So our shipwrecked mariner and rustic philosopher
night after night mounted the stairs to the outlook window,
and saw the stars rise and set, and was glad that
he was living.</p>

<p>He shared his life with the shepherd-boy. He lived
outside of himself, as it were—all did then.</p>

<p>Dennis often joined the story-tellers on the Alden
green and in the war-office store. At the store the wayfarers
bartered in a curious way: they swapped stories.
The drovers were a pack of clever story-tellers, but also the
wayfarers from the sea.</p>

<p>Dennis O’Hay, who had been used to the docks of
Belfast, Liverpool, and London, saw some strange sights
on his rides to secure stores for the army, and saltpeter
among the hill towns.</p>

<p>One cold March day he stopped before the fence of a
hillside farmhouse, and his eye rested upon the most curious
object that he had ever beheld in his life. It seemed
to be a sheep dressed in man’s clothing, eating old sprouts
from cabbage stumps.</p>

<p>He sat on his horse and watched the man, or sheepman,
as the case might be.</p>

<p>“Ye saints and sinners,” said he, “and did any one
ever see the like o’ that before? Not a man in sheep’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
clothing, but a sheep in a man’s clothing, browsing on
last year’s second growth of cabbage. I must call at the
door and find out the meaning o’ that.”</p>

<p>He called to the sheep:</p>

<p>“You there, baa, baa, baa!”</p>

<p>The sheep in his jacket answered him, “Baa-baa,” and
came running to the gate as if to welcome him.</p>

<p>Dennis dismounted and pulled the strap of the door.</p>

<p>The sheep followed him to the door, and when the
latter was opened, announced the arrival of a stranger
by a baa.</p>

<p>A tall, elderly man stood at the door, dressed in a
new woolen suit. He had a high neck-stock, and bowed
in a very stately way. He had manners.</p>

<p>“An’ I am out on business for the Governor,” said
Dennis.</p>

<p>“You are welcome,” said the tall man. “Any one in
the service of the Governor is welcome to my home, and
to the best of my scanty fare.” He bowed again.</p>

<p>Dennis walked in, so did the sheep, with many baas.</p>

<p>“Take a place before the fire,” said the tall old man.
“I feel the snows of age falling upon me,” he continued.
“The sun and the light of the moon will soon be darkened
to me, and the clouds already return after the
rain.</p>

<p>“The keepers of the house tremble,” here he lifted
his hands, which shook with a slight palsy; “and the
grinders cease because they are few,” here he pointed to
his almost toothless gums; “and those that look out of
the windows be darkened,” here he took a pair of spectacles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
from his eyes. He talked almost wholly in scriptural
language.</p>

<p>The sheltered sheep said baa, and dropped down before
the fire. Dennis knew not what to say, but uttered a
yum, when the tall man broke out again: “The sound
of the grinding is low, and I fear when I walk on the
places that are high, and the grasshopper is a burden.
Yes, my friend, the silver cord will soon be loosed, and
the golden bowl broken and the pitcher at the fountain
and wheel at the cistern. You find me a reed shaken
by the wind, a trembling old man; but I have never
seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging
bread. I am at your service; my house, such as it
is, is yours.” He bowed, and turned around and
bowed.</p>

<p>“I am out and about collecting saltpeter,” said Dennis,
“and all that I ask is to warm myself by your fire, except,
except—well, that shorn sheep puzzles my wits. Pardon
me, I beg a thousand pardons if I seem uncivil, but why
is it dressed up in that way?”</p>

<p>“I will explain and enlighten your curiosity, my
friendly traveler. The sheep has on my old clothing,
and I have on his.”</p>

<p>He continued: “I am the teacher here, and my pay
is small, and the war taxes take all I can save. My old
clothes became very worn, as you can see there, and I
had to maintain my dignity. I am a graduate of Yale,
and so I exchanged clothing with my one sheep.</p>

<p>“My noble wife brought it about; she is at her wheel
now. Let me call her and introduce her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>He opened a door to a room where a wheel was whirling
and buzzing like a northern wind.</p>

<p>“May, my dear!”</p>

<p>May appeared. The withered man bowed, holding
his right hand in air on a level with his forehead. May
made a courtesy.</p>

<p>“Behold a virtuous woman,” said the tall man, with
manners. “Her price is above rubies.</p>

<p>“The heart of her husband does safely trust in her,
that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>

<p>“She seeketh wool and flax.”</p>

<p>Here the sheep seemed to be in a familiar atmosphere,
and responded in his one word, baa.</p>

<p>“She layeth hands on the spindle, and holds the distaff.
Her household are clothed in scarlet. Her children
rise up and call her blessed, and her husband praiseth
her.”</p>

<p>Dennis had seen many parts of the world, but he had
never been introduced to any one in that way before.</p>

<p>The old man added, much to the wonder and amusement
of his guest:</p>

<p>“I sheared the sheep and <em>she</em> carded the wool, and
she spun the wool and wove it into strong cloth, and dyed
the cloth, and here I am clothed against the storm. You
see what a wife I have got.”</p>

<p>“And what a sheep you have got, too,” said Dennis.
“But may the Lord protect you both. You have a heart
to let the sheep warm himself by your fire, and that is
why you give me a place here.”</p>

<p>“And now, wife,” said the tall man, “place the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
that you have on the table for the stranger. ‘Be not
forgetful to entertain strangers.’”</p>

<p>“But, my dear consort, we have only one cake left
for us two.”</p>

<p>“Well, give that to him, and we will go supperless
to Him who owns the cattle upon a thousand hills. He
is riding in the cause of liberty, and needs the cake more
than we. God will give us the white stone and the hidden
manna, and to serve the patriots we have gone supperless
before.”</p>

<p>Queer as it may seem, this story pictures the time.
This man plowed with a cow, but treated the animal as if
she was a member of the household; men and animals suffered
together then in those hard, sturdy, and glorious old
New England days.</p>

<p>“This is a queer country,” said Dennis, “but what
men it makes! What will they be when they are free!”</p>

<p>But now came the disastrous battle of Long Island.
New York was taken, and the fall winds began to blow.</p>

<p>There was sadness in every true American’s heart.
England was rejoicing, and felt secure in the rising success
of her arms.</p>

<p>Washington appealed to Trumbull. A former appeal
had come in spring-time, when Putnam left his plow in
the furrow.</p>

<p>The appeal now came in harvest-time. What were
the farmers to do?</p>

<p>“The wives and boys and old men will harvest the
crops,” was the public answer. “Save Washington <em>again</em>,
Brother Jonathan!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>It was in 1777. Disaster had again befallen the American
army, and Lord Howe was on the sea.</p>

<p>Where was the British commander going? Some
thought to the Hudson River, some to Philadelphia. No
patriot could know.</p>

<p>Washington was in great distress and perplexity.</p>

<p>Putnam commanded Philadelphia. In this crisis a
young man presented himself to General Putnam.</p>

<p>“I am a patriot at heart,” he said, “but have been
with Lord Howe. I have been commanded by Lord Howe
to bear a letter to General Burgoyne, but, true to the
American cause, I have brought the letter to you.”</p>

<p>The letter was, or seemed to be, in the handwriting
of Lord Howe. It was sent to Washington. It informed
Burgoyne that the fleet was about to proceed against
Boston.</p>

<p>“The letter is a feint,” said Washington. But he read
into it the real design of Lord Howe, which was to proceed
against him, and he was thrown by it into the greatest
perplexity.</p>

<p>He must have more troops, and at once. He consulted
Putnam, and said: “I want you to send an express
to Governor Trumbull at once. Tell him to send the
State militia without delay. He will not fail me.” He
added: “Connecticut can not be in more danger than this.
Governor Trumbull will, I trust, be sensible to this. I
must appeal again to Brother Jonathan.”</p>

<p>These were nearly Washington’s own words to Connecticut
Putnam, of the fearless heart.</p>

<p>Putnam sent a courier to Connecticut, a man on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
winged horse, as it were, who “flew” as Dennis had
done.</p>

<p>“If you ever rode, ride now,” was the probable order.
“If we ever had need of Brother Jonathan, it is now.”</p>

<p>Still Brother Jonathan, whose heart was like a hammer
and head like a castle. This courier was destined
to startle indeed the people of the cedars.</p>

<p>The American army was in dire distress and Lord
Howe was on the sea!</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan! He had grown now in reputation
so that the hearts of the people beyond his own State were
his. If he could save the situation he would indeed be the
first of patriots.</p>

<p>The messenger came, and said: “I am sent to you from
Washington.”</p>

<p>The Governor turned to the courier:</p>

<p>“Go to the tavern; take your horse and yourself, and
say to your chief, ‘It shall be done!’”</p>

<p>What was it that should be done?</p>

<p>The Council of Safety assembled in the back store.</p>

<p>“Washington waits another regiment,” said one of
the members in the back store.</p>

<p>“Yes, so it seems,” said another. “Every point seems
to be threatened.”</p>

<p>“We may find it hard to raise another regiment,” said
a third member.</p>

<p>“One,” said the Governor, “one regiment? We
must raise <span class="allsmcap">NINE</span>! We can do it.”</p>

<p>“Will the men descend from the sky?” questioned
one. “We can not create men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“He can who thinks he can,” said the Governor.
“Nine regiments he needs, and nine regiments he shall
have. Shall he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said all, “if you can find the men.”</p>

<p>“I can find the men. Dennis?”</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>The shell was blown. The latch-string bobbed.</p>

<p>“Dennis, Washington must have <span class="allsmcap">NINE</span> regiments for
the defense of New York. That means work for you.
Go to the towns—fly! Tell the selectmen that Washington
wants men. He has sent his appeal to me; he has
put confidence in my heart, notwithstanding my weak
hands. He shall not appeal in vain. Go, Dennis; these
days are to live again. I feel the divinity of the times;
I must act, though I myself am nothing. Go to Norwich,
Hartford, New Haven—fly, Dennis, fly!”</p>

<p>“I am not a bird, your Honor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dennis, you are. Fly!” That word was the
order now.</p>

<p>Then the Governor talked with the Committee of
Safety in the back store until midnight.</p>

<p>The candles went out, and the men slept there.</p>

<p>The nine regiments of three hundred and fifty men
each were raised.</p>

<p>Men were few in old Windham County now. “Gone
to the war,” answered many inquiries.</p>

<p>The women led the teams to the field; the old men,
old women, and the boys went to the husk-heap and husked
corn. The boys learned to use the threshing flails and
winnowing sieves in the barns with open doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>The young and old filled the potato bins in the cellar
and stored the apples there. They banked the houses
with thatch.</p>

<p>Governor Trumbull was now at the full age when the
vital powers ripen, and when many men begin to abate
their activities. But he seemed to forget his age; he
was never so active as now.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp154">
  <img src="images/i_fp154.jpg"  alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_v">Jonathan Trumbull.</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Washington noted this activity of age with wonder,
and he wrote to him: “I observe with great pleasure that
you have ordered the remaining regiments of militia that
can be spared from the immediate defense of the seacoast
to march toward New York with all expedition.
I can not sufficiently express my thanks.” To which
Brother Jonathan replied:</p>

<p>“When your Excellency was pleased to request the
militia of our State to be sent forward with all possible
expedition to reenforce the army at New York, no time
was lost to expedite the march; and I am happy to find
the spirit and zeal that appeared in the people of this
State, to yield every assistance in their power in the
present critical situation of our affairs. The season, indeed,
was most unfavorable for so many of our farmers
and laborers to leave home. Many had not even secured
their harvest; the greater part had secured but a small
part even of their hay, and the preparation of the crop
of winter’s grain for the ensuing year was totally omitted;
but they, the most of them, left all to afford their help
in protecting and defending their just rights and liberties
against the attempt of a numerous army sent to invade
them. The suddenness of the requisition, the haste and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
expedition required in the raising, equipping, and marching
such a number of men after the large drafts before
made on this State, engrossed all our time and attention.”</p>

<p>The people forgot themselves for the cause. When
Washington and Trumbull made a call upon them for help
it was like Moses and Aaron. They did not argue or question;
they hurried to the village greens, there to receive
their orders as from the Deity.</p>

<p>That autumn the Governor issued a wonderful proclamation
for a day of fasting and prayer.</p>

<p>The bell rang; the people assembled. Trumbull always
attended church, and the chair in which he used to
sit is still shown in Lebanon. The people followed his
example. They felt that what was best for them would
be best for their children, and that whether they left
them rich estates or not, they must bequeath them liberty
and the examples of virtue. So they lived <em>mightily</em> in
“Brother Jonathan’s day.”</p>

<small>BEACONS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There is one history of the Revolution that has never
been written; it is that of <em>beacons</em>. The beacon, in the
sense of a signal, was the night alarm, the night order.
The hills on which beacons were set were those that could
be seen from afar, and those who planted these far angles
of communications of light were patriots, like the rest.</p>

<p>There was a beacon at Mt. Hope, R. I. It probably
signaled to a beacon on King’s Rocks, Swansea, which
picturesque rocks are near to the Garrison House at Myles
Bridge, and the Swansea church, founded in the spirit
of liberty and learning by the famous John Myles, a
learned exile from Wales, who came to Swansea, Mass.,
for religious liberty, bringing his church records from
Swansea, Wales, with him. The old Hessian burying-ground
is near the place. Here John Myles founded
education in the spirit of the education of all. He made
every house a schoolhouse by becoming a traveling
teacher.</p>

<p>The King’s Rocks beacon communicated with Providence,
and Providence probably with Boston.</p>

<p>In Boston was the beacon of beacons. Beacon Hill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
now bears its name. A book might be written in regard
to this famous beacon. It stood on Sentry Hill, a tall
mast overlooking city and harbor, not at first with a
globe on the top and an eagle on the globe, as is represented
on the monument. Sentry Hill was the highest
of the hills of Trimountain. The golden dome of the
State-house marks the place now.</p>

<p>The first beacon in Boston was erected here in 1635.
It was an odd-looking object.</p>

<p>The general court of Massachusetts thus gave the
order for the erection of the beacon:</p>

<p>“It is ordered that there shall be a beacon set on
Sentry Hill, to give notice to the country of danger.”</p>

<p>The beacon had a peg ladder and a crane, on which
was hung an iron pot.</p>

<p>This beacon seems to have remained for nearly one
hundred and fifty years. It was the suggestion of beacons
in many places, and these were the telegraph stations of
the Revolutionary War. A history of the beacons would
be a history of the war.</p>

<p>What a signal it made as it blazed in the heavens!
What eyes were turned toward it in the nights of alarm
of the Indian wars, and again in the strenuous times of
the expedition against Louisburg, and in all the years of
the great Revolution! A tar-barrel was placed on the
beacon-mast in perilous times, and it flamed in the sky
like a comet when the country was in danger.</p>

<p>Beacon (or Sentry) Hill was almost a mountain then.
The owners lowered it for the sake of gravel for private
and public improvements. It filled hollows and lengthened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
wharves, and at last the beacon gave place to the
monument of its usefulness.</p>

<p>In New York beacons were set along the highlands
whose tops fired the night sky in times of danger.</p>

<p>These beacons or signals probably suggested the semaphore—a
system of signals with shutters and flags used
in France during the wars of Napoleon.</p>

<p>Governor Trumbull said one day to Dennis: “We
must consider the matter of beacons.”</p>

<p>The two went into the war office to consider.</p>

<p>“I will bring the subject before the Committee,” said
the Governor after they had “considered” the matter
for a time, “and you may get Peter to point out to you
the longest lookouts on the high hills. The sky must be
made to speak for the cause in tongues of fire.”</p>

<p>The Tories more and more hated the war Governor.</p>

<p>“I would kill him as I would a rattlesnake,” said one
of these.</p>

<p>There were new plots everywhere among Tory people
to destroy him and his great influence.</p>

<p>Peter Nimble, though really a guard on secret service,
still herded sheep and roamed after his flocks and guided
them in the pleasant seasons of pasturage. He went up on
the hills of the savins above the cedar swamps. He knew
the hills better than many of the people of Lebanon.</p>

<p>One day he met the Governor on the green.</p>

<p>“Governor,” he said, “I watch at nights. You know
all. I watch for spies that are looking for the magazines.
You know, Governor. I can do you a greater service
than that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“Well, boy, you speak well. What can you do?”</p>

<p>“I can think and talk with the skies.”</p>

<p>“That is bravely said, but what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I can set beacons on the hills. I have studied the
hilltops, and how to look far. I can see how I could
flash a signal from one hill to Plainfield, and to Providence,
and to New London.”</p>

<p>“Boy, boy, you see. I can trust you. Have you
told Mr. Williams of this? Shepherd-boy, shepherd-boy,
you are one after my own heart. Find out the way to
set beacons. Set signals. How did this knowledge come
to you?”</p>

<p>“My heart is full of my country, when I am among
the flocks on the hills.”</p>

<p>“You are like another David. Talk with Dennis
about these things.”</p>

<p>“Governor?”</p>

<p>“Well, my shepherd-boy?”</p>

<p>“One day, it may be, I will see something.”</p>

<p>The Governor went to his war office. People were
coming from four different ways, all to consult with the
Governor: horsemen, men in gigs, men from the ships,
people with provisions, all with something special to say
to the Governor.</p>

<p>The Governor met William Williams, “the signer,”
at the door of the war office.</p>

<p>“That is a bright boy that you keep to herd sheep,”
said he.</p>

<p>“Peter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has just said something to me that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
think remarkable. Give him freedom to do much as he
pleases. He is carrying out secret instructions of mine.”</p>

<p>Peter studied hilltops, and told Dennis of all the curious
angles that he discerned on the far and near hills.
He set beacons and found out how he could communicate
with Plainfield, Providence, and Groton.</p>

<p>In the meantime he watched in the midnight hours
at an angle in the turnpike road behind the curious window.
He knew that the magazine was near; he did not
seek to learn where. While the young patriot’s mind
was employed in these things there came to him one night
a very strange adventure, which led him to see to how
great peril the Governor’s person was exposed.</p>

<p>Peter thought much of his aged uncle, the wood-chopper,
who had said to him, “Out you go!” The boy
had a forgiving heart. “He did it on account of his love
for the King, and he thinks that a king is appointed by
God,” he would say to the Governor. “Do not disturb
him.”</p>

<p>The Governor would not disturb him. He, too, had
a forgiving heart.</p>

<p>Peter’s heart was true to the old man. He sometimes
wondered as to where would fall the old man’s gold at
last—to the King, or him. But he had no selfish schemes
in the matter—for him to do right was to live. In his
midnight watches, and with his most curious means of
communication with the alarm-post in the cedars, he held
one purpose uppermost: it was, to protect from harm the
unselfish Governor who had spoken so kindly to him when
his heart was hungry, and whom all the people loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>The Governor still went about with apparent unconcern;
he would talk here and there with those who detained
him and needed him, now at the tavern, now upon
the village green. But the people all knew that dangerous
people were coming and going to and from the green-walled
town.</p>

<p>Peter saw something suspicious in the conduct of several
sailors who visited the place from the ports, and who
called the inland province the Connecticut main.</p>

<p>“I would sooner die myself,” he said to Dennis,
“than to see any harm befall the Governor. ‘Greater
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
for his friends.’” He had learned to quote Scripture from
the Governor.</p>

<p>One night as he was watching with his window at the
elbow of the turnpike, he was surprised to hear a soft,
slow, cautious footfall, and to see a curious stranger in
a blanket approaching in the dim light. He turned up
the hill behind the window and light to see if the man
in the blanket would follow him.</p>

<p>The man in the blanket turned when Peter set down
the window, and went down the hill as from a house to
meet the traveler.</p>

<p>Peter stopped the stranger, whom he saw to be dark
and tall, and who held under his blanket some weapon
which seemed to be a hatchet.</p>

<p>“Do you live in yonder house?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said the boy, “that is not my house. Whom
are you seeking?”</p>

<p>“Does an old man live there?” asked the stranger.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
“An old man who used to live with a boy—his brother’s
boy?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered Peter in much surprise.</p>

<p>“Do you know of any old man that lives all alone?
They say that the boy has left him.”</p>

<p>“I have in mind such an old man, stranger.”</p>

<p>“What became of the boy?”</p>

<p>“He tends sheep during the days.”</p>

<p>“Can you direct me to the place where the old man
lives?”</p>

<p>“What would you have of him?”</p>

<p>“I would have him help me. I need help.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever meet him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How did you hear of him?”</p>

<p>“I am partly an Indian. The scholars of the Indian
school that were once here used to meet him on the road
in front of his woodpile. They heard that he had concealed
money. Indian need heap money. Indian must
have help.”</p>

<p>The last sentence showed that the Indian spoke true
in regard to his nationality.</p>

<p>A suspicion flashed across Peter’s mind; this stray Indian
was out in the forest at this time with no honest
purpose.</p>

<p>He simply said: “Follow me.”</p>

<p>He led the Indian to the alarm-post. The Indian
thought that he was going to the wood-chopper’s
cabin. Dennis received the night wanderer and detained
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“I must go and alarm my uncle,” said Peter to Dennis,
privately.</p>

<p>He hurried away toward the old wood-chopper’s cabin.</p>

<p>He beat on the door, and cried:</p>

<p>“Lift the latch!”</p>

<p>There was a noise within, and presently the latch was
lifted.</p>

<p>“You, boy? You? What brings you here at this
time of night?”</p>

<p>“To warn you of danger. There has been a man in
the cedar swamp who is seeking you, and he has no honest
purpose in his heart, as I could see. He is a half-breed.
He says that you have money concealed.”</p>

<p>The old man’s face took on a look of terror.</p>

<p>He began to dance around.</p>

<p>“Who—ah—says that I have money concealed?” he
said, lighting a candle—“who—who—who?” He lit another
light.</p>

<p>“Boy, you are not deceiving me? You never deceived
anybody. And what a heart you must have to come here
to protect an old man like me, who said to you, ‘Out you
go!’ And you have held no hardness against me—I have
cursed you—because you have turned against the King.
Come in—sit down—I am afraid. You don’t think that
the Indian meant to rob me, do you?”</p>

<p>“I think he intended to find you in the night and
beg money, and if you refused him to demand money,
and if you refused him, then to find out where you hid
money. If I had not turned him aside, I don’t believe
that you would have been living in the morning. Bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
Indians murder lone men by lonely ways. There was
crime in his eye.”</p>

<p>“Boy, let me bar the door. I know your heart. You
had a mother who had a true heart, and a boy’s heart
is his mother’s heart. You only come here for a good
purpose. I know that. And you have come in to-night
to protect me, who turned you out.</p>

<p>“Boy, I have money. I am willing to tell you now
where it is!”</p>

<p>“But, uncle, I am not seeking your money—I do not
wish to know where it is.”</p>

<p>“But you must—you must; you are the only friend
that I have on earth. What made me say, ‘Out you go!’
when I needed you?</p>

<p>“The money—if ever I should die, do you come back
here and take all I leave, and wash and wash and wash
until you find the bottom of the soap-barrel. There, I
haven’t told you anything. People don’t hide money in
the soap-barrel—no, no; lye eats—no, no. You know
enough now. Will you stay with me until morning?”</p>

<p>“No; I have come to take you to the war office,
for protection—to the store. One room there is almost
always open.”</p>

<p>“To the Governor’s! He suspects me of being a Tory.
What would the King say, if he were to know that I
went to the rebel Governor for protection? No, no, no,
no. Let the Indians kill me—I will die true to my king.
You may go—you will not betray me.”</p>

<p>“I can not leave you until morning, and then I will
see that you are guarded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“Who will guard me?”</p>

<p>“The Governor will see that you are kept from harm.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no. Go, Peter, go—out into the night. I
want the King to know that he has one heart that is true
to him in the land of the cedars. Go! I will bolt my
door nights—and will chop wood. That is what I tell
people who come to visit me—I chop wood—and I will
say no more.</p>

<p>“You would die for the Governor, and I am willing
to suffer any danger for my king—for King George of
Hanover. Go!”</p>

<p>Peter went out into the night. There was something
in his grim uncle’s loyalty that kindled his admiration,
and there was a touch in the old man’s desire that he
should possess his property that really awakened a chord
of love in his heart. He resolved that he would be as
true to the old man as ever his duties to the cause would
allow, although the rugged Tory had said to him a second
time, “Out you go!” The heart knows its own.</p>

<p>Peter could ride like the wind. So the people said
“that he streaked it through the air.” With his night
service, and his placing of beacons on the hills, and his
place at the door of the war office in the store, which
he yet sometimes filled, and the spirit that he had shown
toward his unhappy old uncle, the wood-chopper, he was
making for himself a personality.</p>

<p>The Governor entrusted him with a message to the
army at Valley Forge.</p>

<p>The Governor’s wife was a noble woman, as we have
seen. She was true to her own. Her family were very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
tender-hearted and affectionate. Her daughter Faith,
who could paint and who had inspired her brother, the
great historic painter, in his boyhood, died of insanity
after hearing the thunders of Bunker Hill. She had married
Colonel Huntington, who went to the camps around
Boston. She hoped to meet him there, but arrived just
as the battle of Bunker Hill was rending the air.</p>

<p>When she thought of what war might mean to her
father, her husband, and her brother, who was an officer,
her mind could not withstand the dark vision that arose
before her, and it went out. She died at Dedham. One
of her brothers, too, had so much of the human and
elemental nature as to have become greatly depressed by
disappointment. The Trumbulls were a marvelous family,
with a divine spark in them all, but not all the children
had the rugged nerve of their father.</p>

<p>The wife of Governor Trumbull guarded her family
when the Governor was absent on official duties at Hartford.</p>

<p>The family now were like so many listeners—to get
tidings from the war was their life, and anxiety filled
their faces as messengers from Boston, Providence,
New London, and Hartford, and the great powder-mills
and ordnance works of hidden Salisbury came to
them.</p>

<p>One evening, when the Governor was away, a messenger
came to the green, and stopped before the tavern.
It was dark and rainy.</p>

<p>“It is the shepherd-boy!” said Faith Trumbull, standing
in the door, with a lantern in her hand. “He has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
returned from Valley Forge. I almost shut my heart
against the news. His face is white.”</p>

<p>The boy came to the house and Madam Trumbull received
him by laying her hand on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Dennis came running in.</p>

<p>“You, my boy Nimble? You made a quick journey.”</p>

<p>The family sat down by the broad, open fire. Their
anxiety was shown by their silence.</p>

<p>“Well,” said madam, “the time has come to speak.
What news?”</p>

<p>“Oh, could you see,” said the shepherd-boy, “shoeless
men, foodless men—snow and blood. When the men
move, the snow lies red behind them. Oh, it makes my
heart sick to tell it. I would think that the stars would
look down in pity.”</p>

<p>“Dennis,” said madam, “call the women of the Relief
Committee here to-night, all of them—now.”</p>

<p>“Let us hear what more the boy has to say.”</p>

<p>“No; suffering has no right to be delayed one moment
of relief. Go now.”</p>

<p>Dennis went out into the night. He returned with the
women, who began to knit stockings for the barefoot soldiers
of Valley Forge.</p>

<p>Madam addressed the women.</p>

<p>“I belong to the Pilgrim Colony,” said she, “but of
that I would not boast. Hear the rain, hear the sleet,
and the wind rising! You have met here in the rain.
The fire burns warm.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you my thoughts—something that comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
to me. It was such a night as this when John Howland
with a band of Pilgrims sailed in the deep darkness, near
the coast, on the shallop of the Mayflower, and he knew
not where he was.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked one of the knitters.</p>

<p>“He sang in the storm. Darkness covered him—there
was ice on the oars as they lifted and fell. There
was no light on the coast. The wind rose and the seas
were pitiless, but he sang—John Howland.”</p>

<p>“What did he sing?”</p>

<p>“That I can not tell. I think that he sang the Psalm
that we sing to the words</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘God is the refuge of his saints,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Though storms of sharp distress invade.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">Let us sing that now. The storm that tossed the shallop
of the Mayflower broke; the clouds lifted. So it will be
at Valley Forge. Knit and sing.”</p>

<p>And the knitters sang. The storm rose to a gale.
Shutters banged, and there was only the tavern lights
to be seen across the black green.</p>

<p>Suddenly a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>Peter opened the door, hat in hand.</p>

<p>“Madam Trumbull,” said he, “may I speak to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Peter, boy; what have you to say?”</p>

<p>“I saw a strange man at Valley Forge. He was young—a
Frenchman.</p>

<p>“One cold night he was standing near Washington in
the marquee, and Washington, the great Washington, put
his own cloak about him, and the two stood under the
same cloak, and some officers gathered around him. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
I heard him say, the young Frenchman: ‘When you shall
hear the <em>bugles of Auvergne</em>, the cause of liberty will have
won the battle of the world.’ What did he mean?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said Madam Robinson; “it seems
like a prophecy; like John Howland, the pilgrim, singing
in the night-storm on the shallop of the Mayflower. The
bugles of Auvergne!—the words seem to ring in my ears.
What was the young Frenchman’s name?”</p>

<p>“Lafayette.”</p>

<p>The next day Peter went to Dennis and related the
same story, and said:</p>

<p>“America will be free when she shall hear the bugles
of Auvergne.”</p>

<p>“So she will; I feel it in my soul she will—the bugles
of Auvergne! That sounds like a silver trumpet from
the skies. But where are the bugles of Auvergne?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, but we will hear them—Lafayette
said so.”</p>

<p>“But who is that same Lafayette?”</p>

<small>THE SECRET OF LAFAYETTE</small></h2>
</div>


<h3>THE STORY OF THE WHITE HORSE</h3>

<p>Lafayette was born on September 6, 1757, in the
province of Auvergne, now Cantal, Puy-de-Dôme, and
Haute-Loire. His birthplace was the Château de Chavagnac,
situated some six miles from ancient Brionde.</p>

<p>Auvergne was celebrated for men of character and
honor rather than wealth and distinction—men who deserved
to outlive kings, and whose jewels were virtues.
It became a proverb that the men of Auvergne knew no
stain, and hence the ensigns and escutcheons of the rugged
soldiers of the mountain towns were associated with the
motto, “Auvergne sans tache.”</p>

<p>These soldiers kept this motto of their mountain homes
ever in view; they would die rather than violate the
spirit of it.</p>

<p>Lafayette was of noble family, and appeared at court
when a boy. But the gay court did not repress the spirit of
Auvergne which lived in him, and grew. He was of noble
family, and his father fell at the battle of Minden. The
battery that caused his father’s death was commanded by
General Phillips, against whom Lafayette fought in the
great Virginia campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>At the age of sixteen, the spirit of the mountaineers
of Auvergne rose within him. He became an ardent advocate
of the liberties of men, and he seemed to see the
star of liberty rising in the Western world, and he was
restless to follow it. He heard of the American Congress
as an assembly of heroes of a new era—the new
Senate of God and human rights. Princes, after his view,
should not violate the law of the people.</p>

<p>The heart of the King of France, while France at
first professed neutrality in the American struggle, was
with the patriots; so was the sympathy of the gay French
court. The boy Lafayette knew this; he longed to carry
this secret news to America.</p>

<p>He came to America, as we have described, with this
secret in his heart.</p>

<p>The capture of Burgoyne in October, 1777, delighted
France. The clock of liberty had struck; it only needed
the aid of France to give independence to the Americans.</p>

<p>Lafayette became more restless. He had married into
a noble family, but the companionship of a beautiful and
true woman could not stifle this patriotic restlessness. He
saw that he might be an influence in bringing France
to the aid of America. To do this became his life.</p>

<p>The Queen espoused the cause of America; let us ever
remember this, notwithstanding that there are so many
unpleasant things about her to remember. Then the
American cause seemed to fail in the Jerseys and France
to lose her interest in it.</p>

<p>Young Lafayette’s heart was true to America in these
dark hours. He knew that France could be aroused to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
action. He espoused the cause of America in her darkness,
and doubtless dreamed of being able to convey to
Washington a secret, that few other men so clearly saw.
France would espouse the cause of America when events
should open the way.</p>

<p>Never such a secret crossed the sea as young Lafayette
bore in his bosom to Washington. It came, as it were,
out of Auvergne; it was borne against every allurement
of luxury and self; it was an inborn imperative. When
a new world was to be revealed, Columbus had to sail;
when liberty was to be established among men, Lafayette,
the child of destiny, had to face the west; where was there
another race of liberty-loving men like those of the Connecticut
farmers? In Auvergne. Who of all men could
represent this spirit of liberty in America? Lafayette.</p>

<p>He won the heart of America; even the British respected
him. His true sympathy was the cause of his
great popularity; his heart won all hearts.</p>

<p>In the terrible winter of 1778 the American army
with Washington and Lafayette were at Valley Forge;
the British were in Philadelphia, spending a gay winter
reveling.</p>

<p>No pen can describe the destitution and suffering of
the 5,000 or more patriots at Valley Forge. The white
snows of that winter in the wilderness were stained with
the blood of naked feet. Famine came with the cold.</p>

<p>The men were “hutted” in log cabins. “The general’s
apartment is very small,” wrote Mrs. Washington;
“he has a log cabin built to dine in, which has made our
quarters much more tolerable than they were at first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>There was no fresh meat there; no sufficient salted
provisions. There were no cattle in the neighboring towns
or States that could be spared for the army.</p>

<p>But they suffered in silence. They went half-clothed
and hungry, but they did not desert.</p>

<p>“Nothing can equal their sufferings,” wrote one of
an examining committee. Even the cannon was frozen
in, and bitten by the frost were the limbs of those who
were commissioned to handle them.</p>

<p>Had General Howe, whose army was dissipating at
Philadelphia, led out his troops against the famine-stricken
army in the Valley, what might have been the fate of
the American cause?</p>

<p>The dissipations of the English army was one cause
of its overthrow. That army had been reveling when
surprised at Trenton.</p>

<p>With his men wasting and dying around him, shoeless,
coatless, foodless, what was Washington to do?</p>

<p>At one of the dismal councils of his generals there
came a counsel that made the hearts all quicken.</p>

<p>“Send to Connecticut for cattle. Let us appeal to
Brother Jonathan again; he has never failed us.”</p>

<p>“I never made an appeal to Brother Jonathan but to
receive help,” said the great commander.</p>

<p>The appeal was made. In his letter to Governor
Trumbull, Washington said:</p>

<p>“What is still more distressing, I am assured by Colonel
Blaine, deputy purchasing commissary for the middle
district, comprehending the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
and Maryland, that they are nearly exhausted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
and the most vigorous and active exertions on his part
will not procure more than sufficient to supply the army
during this month, if so long. This being the case, and
as any relief that can be obtained from the more southern
States will be but partial, trifling, and of a day, we must
turn our eyes to the eastward, and lay our account of
support from thence. Without it, we can not but disband.
I must, therefore, sir, entreat you in the most earnest
terms, and by that zeal which has eminently distinguished
your character in the present arduous struggle, to give
every countenance to the person or persons employed in
the purchasing line in your State, and to urge them to
the most vigorous efforts to forward supplies of cattle
from time to time, and thereby prevent such a melancholy
and alarming catastrophe.”</p>

<p>Read these words twice: “Without it the army must
disband.”</p>

<p>As soon as Governor Trumbull had received the letter
he called together the Council of Safety. He read it
to them. They wept.</p>

<p>“An army of cattle might save the cause,” said one.</p>

<p>“Our suffering brothers shall have the army of cattle,”
said Brother Jonathan.</p>

<p>He at once aroused the farmers of Connecticut.
Horsemen dashed hither and thither, away from Hartford
and from the war office to the hillside farms.</p>

<p>“Cattle! cattle!” they cried. “Our army is perishing.
Washington has appealed to Brother Jonathan!”</p>

<p>At the head of these alarmists rode Dennis O’Hay,
awakening the villages with his resonant brogue:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“It is cattle, an army of cattle, that Washington must
have now! His men are going barefooted in the snow.
Oh, the shame of it! His men have no meat to warm
their veins in the cold. Oh, the shame of it! They fever,
they wither, they are buried in clumps and clods. Oh,
the shame of it! Arouse, or the heavens will fall down on
you! Cattle! Cattle!”</p>

<p>The thrifty hillside farmers had made many sacrifices
already, but they responded.</p>

<p>An army of cattle began to form. It increased.
Nearly every farm could spare one or more beeves, armed
with fat flesh and warm hides.</p>

<p>So it started, armed, as it were, with horns, Dennis
leading them under officers.</p>

<p>Three hundred miles it marched, gathering force along
the way.</p>

<p>It entered at last the dreary wilderness of the suffering
camp. The men saw it coming. There went up a
great shout, which ran along the camp, and went up from
even the hospital huts:</p>

<p>“The Lord bless Brother Jonathan!”</p>

<p>The officers hailed the cattle-drivers.</p>

<p>“Should we win our independence,” said an officer,
“what will we not owe to Brother Jonathan and his army
of cattle from the provision State!”</p>

<p>Dennis froze with the others that winter.</p>

<p>In the spring he returned, moneyless, fameless. Half
of his face was black, and one hand had gone. The explosion
of a powder-wagon which he had been forcing
on toward Washington’s army had caused the change in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
his appearance, but it was rugged work that Dennis O’Hay
had done during that past winter for the army.</p>

<p>The Governor heard his story.</p>

<p>“Dennis O’Hay,” said he, “when America achieves
her liberty, and her true history shall be written, the
inspired historian will see in such as you the cause of
the mighty event. It is men who are willing to suffer and
be forgotten that advance the welfare of mankind; it is
not wealth or fame that lifts the world: it is sacrifice,
sacrifice, sacrifice! That means you, Dennis O’Hay.</p>

<p>“Dennis, did you know that they once offered me
the place of the colonial agent to London? They did,
and I refused for the good of my own people at home.
That is a sweet thing for me to remember. The only
thing that a man can have in this world to last is righteous
life. This is true, Dennis: that the private soldier
who seeks all for his cause and nothing for himself is the
noblest man in the annals of war, unless it be a Washington.”</p>

<p>“And you, Governor Trumbull.”</p>

<p>Dennis took off his hat and bowed low.</p>

<p>The Governor also took off his hat and bowed twice,
and the people who had gathered around took off their
hats and shouted.</p>

<p>“The stars will hear ye when ye shout for Brother
Jonathan,” said Dennis O’Hay. “I have brought home
a secret with me.”</p>

<p>“What may it be?” asked many.</p>

<p>“It would not be a secret were I to tell it.”</p>

<p>Dennis, after driving his army of cattle, with underdrivers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
had entered lustily the place of the halted army
of desolation. He had remained there until spring. He
was greeted there one day by two men, one a tower of
majestic manhood, the other a glittering young man of
warm heart and enthusiasm; they were Washington and
Lafayette.</p>

<p>“Your army will save us, my good friend,” said the
man of majestic presence.</p>

<p>“This army will save the cause,” said the younger
officer.</p>

<p>There was a look of hope in his face that revealed
to Dennis that he had some secret ground for this confidence.</p>

<p>Washington moved away to his marquee.</p>

<p>Dennis, hat in hand, said to Lafayette:</p>

<p>“May I detain you a moment, your Honor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my honest man; what would you have? I hope
that it may be something that I can grant.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember that day when you spoke of a body
of men as the bugles of Auvergne?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my good friend, and how do those words impress
you?”</p>

<p>“I can never tell. They are words within words.
What I want to ask of you is—pardon my bluntness, I
was not bred in courts, as you see—couldn’t you induce
those men who blow the bugles of Ovan to come here
and give us a lift? My heart tells me that they would
be just the men we would need. I don’t so much hear
words as the spirit of things, and the heart knows its
own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“I will think of these things, my good friend of the
honest heart. I do think of them now. I will entrust
you, a stranger, with a secret. Will you never tell it until
the day that makes it clear arrives?”</p>

<p>“Never, never, never—oh, my heart dances when I
hear good things of the cause of these people struggling
so mightily for their liberties—no, no, the tail goes with
the kite; I will never tell.”</p>

<p>“I am now writing to the court of France. If I get
good news, I will ask for the French mountaineers whose
banner is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i>!”</p>

<p>“May the heavens all take off their hats to ye and
the evil one never get ye. I can see them coming now,
a kind o’ vision, with their banners flying. I have second
sight, and see good things. Why do not people see good
things now, like the prophets of old, and not witches and
ghosts? To Dennis O’Hay the passing clouds are angels’
chariots. Oh, I will never forget you, and I would deem
it an honor above honors if you will not forget Dennis
O’Hay.”</p>

<p>“One thing more, good Dennis, I have to say to you
before we part. If a French ship should come to Norwich
from Lyons, you may learn more about Auvergne, which
is the Connecticut of France.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be like the Governor, who is so all
wrapped up in the cause that he has forgotten to grow
old.”</p>

<p>The young French officer drew his cloak about him,
and touched his hat and went to the marquee.</p>

<p>Dennis laid down to rest among some wasted men of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
the army by a fire of fagots. He dreamed, and he saw
French ships sailing in the air. He had read the success
of the cause amid all these miseries in the heart of young
Lafayette.</p>

<p>“That boy general has the vision of it all,” said he.</p>

<p>The Irishman as a bearer of despatches from Governor
Trumbull was not without importance.</p>

<p>Dennis lingered to rest by the marquees of the officers
under the moon and stars. He listened for words of hope.
One night Lafayette talked. He engaged all ears.</p>

<p>“I was born at Auvergne, in the mountain district of
France,” said he, “and the soldiers of Auvergne are sons
of liberty. They are mountaineers. I would that I could
induce France to send an army of those mountaineers to
America. They are rugged men; they believe in justice,
and equal rights, and equal laws, and for this cause they
are willing to die. They have a grand motto, to which
they have always been true. It is ‘Auvergne sans tache’—Auvergne
without a stain. I love a soldier of Auvergne,
a mountaineer of the glorious air in which I was
born.”</p>

<p>His mind seemed to wander back to the past.</p>

<p>“‘Auvergne sans tache,’” said he. “‘Auvergne sans
tache’—these words command me, they have entered
into my soul. Would these men were here, and that I
could lead them to victory!”</p>

<p>Dennis caught the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“And sure, your Honor, people find what they seek,
and all good dreams come true sometime, and you will
bring them here some day. I seem to feel it in my soul.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>The officers shouted.</p>

<p>“And it is from Connecticut I am.”</p>

<p>The young Frenchman may never have heard of the
place before.</p>

<p>“And brought despatches to General Putnam from
Brother Jonathan.</p>

<p>“May I ask what were these words of the French
mountaineers who are just like us—‘Auvergne sans
tache’? I wonder if this poor head can carry those words
back to Lebanon green—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ovan-saan-tarche</i>! The words
ring true, like a bell that rings for the future. I somehow
feel that I will hear them again somewhere. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ovan-saan-tarche,
Ovan-saan-tarche!</i> I will go now. I must
tell the Governor and all the people about it on the
green—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ovan-saan-tarche</i>! What shall I tell the people
of the cedars?”</p>

<p>“Tell the people of the cedars that there is a young
French officer in the camp here that thinks that he carries
in his heart a secret that will give liberty to America;
that aid will come from a district in France that
grows men like the cedars.”</p>

<p>Now the secret of Lafayette haunted the mind of
Dennis.</p>

<p>“A spandy-dandy boy told me something strange,”
said he to the Governor, on his return. “He was a
Frenchman, with a shelving forehead and red hair, and
Washington seemed to be hugging his company, as it
were; the General saw something in him that others did
not see. I think he has what you would call a discerning
of spirits. I thought I saw the same thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“Washington, it is likely, relies on this officer, because
the young Frenchman believes in him and in the
cause,” said the Governor. “Washington is human, and
he must have a lonesome heart, and he must like to have
near him those who believe in him and in the cause.
That is natural.”</p>

<p>There was to be a corn-roast in the cedars—a popular
gathering where green corn was roasted on the ear by a
great fire and distributed among the people.</p>

<p>Had Lebanon been nearer the sea there would have
been a clambake, as the occasion of bringing together
the people, instead of a corn-roast.</p>

<p>At the clambakes bivalves and fish were roasted on
heated stones under rock-weed, sea-weed, and a covering
of sail-cloth, the latter to keep down the steam.</p>

<p>The people gathered for the corn-roast, bringing luscious
corn in the green husks, new potatoes, apples, and
fruit. The women brought pandowdy, or pot-pies, made
of apples baked in dough, which candied in baking, and
also brown bread, and rye and Indian bread, and perhaps
“no cake,” all of which was to be eaten on the carpet of
the dry needles of the great pines that mingled among
the cedars.</p>

<p>This was to be a lively gathering, for a report had
gone abroad that Dennis had seen a prophet and had
received great news from a young French officer, and
that he would tell his story among the speeches on that
day.</p>

<p>It was in the serene and sunny days of September.
The locusts made a silvery, continuous music in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
trees. The birds were gathering for migrations. The
fields were full of goldenrod and wild asters, and the
oaks by the wayside were here and there loaded with
purple grapes.</p>

<p>The people came to the cedar grove from near and
from far, and every one seemed interested in Dennis.</p>

<p>The Irishman towered above them all, bringing deadwood
for the fires.</p>

<p>The feast was eaten on the ground, and the people
were merry, all wondering what story Dennis, who had
been to the army and seen the great Washington himself,
would have to tell.</p>

<p>The people watched him as he brought great logs on
his shoulders to feed the fire where the corn was roasted.</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan and his good wife came to the goodly
gathering. The people arose to greet him, and the
children gathered around him, and looked up to him as
a patriarch. He was then some sixty-seven years old.</p>

<p>After the feast he lifted his hands and spoke to the
people. The cedar birds gathered around him in the trees,
and one adventurous crow came near and cawed. Dennis
threw a stick at the crow, and said:</p>

<p>“Be civil now, and listen to the Governor!”</p>

<p>After the Governor had spoken, “Elder” Williams
spoke. But it was from Dennis that the people most
wished to hear.</p>

<p>They called upon the village esquire to speak.</p>

<p>He was a portly man. He arose and said:</p>

<p>“I will not detain you long. It is Dennis for whom
you are waiting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>He said a few words, and then called:</p>

<p>“Dennis? Dennis O’Hay?”</p>

<p>“At your service,” said Dennis, drawing near, hat
in hand.</p>

<p>“Dennis, they say that you met a prophet in the
army.”</p>

<p>“That I did, sir, and I mind me the secret of the
skies is in his heart.”</p>

<p>“How did he look?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was a skit of a man, with a slanting roof to
his forehead, and lean-to at the back of it. He was all
covered with spangles and bangles, and he followed the
great Washington here and there, like as if he was his
own son. That is how it was, sir.”</p>

<p>The people wondered. This was not the kind of a
prophet that Elder Williams had preached about in the
Lebanon pulpit for twoscore years.</p>

<p>The elder stood up, and said: “Be reverent, my young
man.”</p>

<p>“That I am, sir. I answered the esquire after the
truth, sir.”</p>

<p>“And what made you think that such a frivolous-looking
man as that could be a prophet? Prophets are elderly
men, and plain in their dress and habits, and grave in
face. Why did you think that this gay young man was
a prophet?”</p>

<p>“Because, your reverence, I could see that Washington
believed in him—the great Washington, and the man
prophesied, too.”</p>

<p>“To whom did he prophesy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“To me, to your humble servant, sir.”</p>

<p>The people laughed in a suppressive way, but wondered
more than ever.</p>

<p>“What did he say, Dennis?”</p>

<p>“That I can never tell, sir. He has a woman’s heart,
sir, and she has a man’s heart, sir, and both have the
people’s heart, sir; and one day there will be fleets on
the sea, sir, and strange armies will appear on our shores,
sir. They may come here, sir, and encamp in the cedars,
sir. Oh, I am an honest man, and seem to see it all, sir.”</p>

<p>“How old is your prophet, Dennis?”</p>

<p>“I would think that he might be twenty, sir; no, a
hundred; no, as old as liberty, sir, with all his bangles
and spangles.”</p>

<p>“That is very strange,” said the esquire. “I fear that
you may have wheels in your head, Dennis—were any
of your people ever a little touched in mind?”</p>

<p>“No, never; they had clear heads. An’ why do I believe
that this young man carries a secret in his heart
that will deliver America? Because he has the heart of
the mountaineers of God. He belongs to the sons of
liberty in France, and little he cares for his bangles and
spangles.”</p>

<p>“But he is too young.”</p>

<p>“No, no; pardon me, sir, he has an ardent heart, that
he has. It is all on fire. Wasn’t David young when
he took up a little pebbly rock and sent the giant sprawling?
Wasn’t King Alfred young when he put down his
foot and planted England? Wasn’t Samuel young when
he heard a voice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>The people began to cheer Dennis.</p>

<p>“The true heart knows its own. Washington’s heart
does.</p>

<p>“You may laugh, but I have met a prophet. The
gold lace on him does not spoil his heart. He comes out
of the past, he is going into the future; he loves everybody,
and everybody that meets him loves him. Laugh if
you will, but Dennis O’Hay has seen a prophet, and you
will see what is in his heart some day.</p>

<p>“He has a motto. What is his motto, do you ask?
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ovan-saan-tarche</i>!—Ovan without a stain. That is the
motto of the soldiers of the place where he was born.
That place is like this place, I mind me. He says:
‘America will be free when she shall hear the bugles
of Ovan.’”</p>

<p>“What is his name?” asked the esquire.</p>

<p>“His name? Bother me if I can remember it now.
It is the same as the boy said. But you will come to
know it some day, now heed you this word in the cedars.
Lafayette—yes, Lafayette—that is his name. It is written
in the stars, but bother me, it flies away from me
now like a bird from a wicker-cage. But, but, hear me,
ye good folks all, receive it, Governor, believe it, esquire—that
young man’s heart holds the secret of America.
There are helpers invisible in this world, and the heavens
elect men for their work, not from any outward appearance,
but from the heart. This is the way God elected
David of old.”</p>

<p>A blue jay had been listening on a long cedar bough
stretched out like an arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>She archly turned her head, raised her crown and
gave a trumpet-call, and flew over the people.</p>

<p>The men shouted, and the women and children
cheered Dennis, and the grave Governor said:</p>

<p>“Life is self-revealing, time makes clear all things,
and if our good man Dennis has indeed discovered a
prophet, it will all be revealed to us some day. Elder
Williams, pray!”</p>

<p>The old man stood up under the cedars; the women
bowed. Then the people went home to talk of the strange
tidings that Dennis had brought them.</p>

<p>Was there, indeed, some hidden secret of personal
power in the heart of this young companion of Washington,
who had made honor his motto and liberty his
star?</p>

<small>LAFAYETTE TELLS HIS SECRET</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There is one part of the career of young Lafayette
that has never been brought into clear light, and that
part was decisive in the destinies of America. It was
his letters home. From the time of his commission
as an officer in the American army he was constantly
writing to French ministers, asking them to use their
influence to send aid to America.</p>

<p>He had the favor of the court, and the heart of the
popular and almost adored Queen. He felt that his letters
must bring to America a fleet. He poured his heart
into them.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp051">The surrender of Burgoyne</a> brought about a treaty
between France and the United States. It was one of
alliance and amity. France recognized the United States
among the powers of the world, and received Dr. Benjamin
Franklin as minister plenipotentiary to the court.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp051">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_187">The surrender of Burgoyne.</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For this great movement the letters of Lafayette had
helped to prepare the way.</p>

<p>His heart rejoiced when he found that this point of
vantage had been gained.</p>

<p>He was the first to receive the news of the treaty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>He went with the tidings to Washington. It revealed
to the strong leader the future.</p>

<p>Washington was a man of silence, but his heart was
touched; a sense of gratitude to Heaven seemed to inspire
him.</p>

<p>“Let public thanksgivings of gratitude ascend to
Heaven,” he said. “Assemble the brigades, and let us
return thanks to God.”</p>

<p>The brigades were assembled. The cannon boomed!
Songs of joy arose and prayers were said.</p>

<p>Then a great shout went up that thrilled the young
heart of Lafayette.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le roi!</i>—Long live the King of France!”</p>

<p>That thanksgiving set the bells of New England to
ringing, and was a means of recruiting the army everywhere.</p>

<p>Lafayette heard the news with a full heart, and he
himself only knew how much he had done silently to renew
the contest for liberty.</p>

<p>Congress began to see his value. They honored him,
and that gave him the influence to say:</p>

<p>“I came here for the cause. I must return to France
for the cause.”</p>

<p>He said of this crisis, and we use his own words here:</p>

<p>“From the moment I first heard the name of America,
I began to love her; from the moment I understood that
she was struggling for her liberties, I burned to shed my
best blood in her cause, and the days I shall devote to the
service of America, whatever and wherever it may be,
will constitute the happiest of my life. I never so ardently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
desired as I do now to deserve the generous sentiments
with which these States and their representatives have
honored me.”</p>

<p>He obtained from Congress permission to return to
France in the interest of the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>It was 1778. He had arrived on the American shores
a mere boy and a stranger. Now that he returned to
France, the hearts of all Americans followed him. He
was twenty-two years of age. He was carrying a secret
with him that he was beginning to reveal and that the
world was beginning to see.</p>

<p>In serving the cause of the States he felt that he was
promoting the cause of the liberty of mankind. France
might one day feel its reaction, burst her old bonds, and
become a giant republic.</p>

<p>France arose to meet him on his return. Havre threw
out her banners to welcome his ship. He was acclaimed,
feasted, and lauded everywhere, until he longed to fly
to some retreat from all of this adoration of a simple
young general.</p>

<p>The Queen, Marie Antoinette, admired him, and became
his patron. She received him and delighted to hear
from him about America and the character of Washington.
Lafayette delighted the Queen with his story of
Washington.</p>

<p>After these interviews, in which Lafayette saw that
he had secured her favor for the American cause, the
Queen had an interview with Dr. Franklin.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said the Queen to Franklin, “that
Lafayette has really made me fall in love with your General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Washington. What a man he must be, and what
a friend he has in the Marquis!”</p>

<p>The court opened its doors to meet him. The King
welcomed him. All Paris acclaimed him. The people
of France were all eager to hear of him.</p>

<p>What an opportunity! Lafayette seized upon it.
He was not moved by the flattery of France. Every
heart-beat was full of his purposes to secure aid for
America.</p>

<p>This he did.</p>

<p>“I will send a fleet to America,” said the King.</p>

<p>The young King was popular then, and this decision
won for him the heart of liberty-enkindled France.</p>

<p>Lafayette’s heart turned home to the heroic mountaineers.</p>

<p>“If it can be done,” he said to the military department,
“let there be sent to America the soldiers of
Auvergne, they of the banners of ‘Auvergne sans
tache.’”</p>

<p>Two hundred young noblemen offered their services
to Lafayette.</p>

<p>He left France for America. Banquet-halls vied with
each other in farewells.</p>

<p>But the night glitter of the palaces were as nothing
to the words of the young King: “You can not
better serve your King than by serving the cause of
America!”</p>

<p>He left France in tears, to be welcomed by shouts of
joy in America.</p>

<p>He brought back the news to Washington that henceforth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
the cause of America and France were one, and
that he hoped soon to welcome here the grenadiers of
Auvergne—“Auvergne sans tache!”—the bugles of Auvergne!</p>

<p>Peter brought the message that announced this great
news to the war office.</p>

<p>The Governor’s face lighted when the boy appeared
at the door.</p>

<p>“What is it now?” he asked. “You always bring
joy to my heart!”</p>

<p>“France in alliance,” said the Governor. “May
France herself live to become a republic. And the
Queen has espoused our cause!”</p>

<p>Peter went from the office with heart full of joy.
Good news from the seat of war made his heart as light
as a bird—it made him whittle and whistle.</p>

<p>Out in the cold, watching nights, Peter’s heart turned
to the wood-chopper, who had seemed to love the King
more than him. He felt that the old man must be lonely
in his cabin, with only the blue jays and the squirrels,
and the like to cheer him. Peter could seem to hear him
chop, chop, chopping wood.</p>

<p>He met him once in the way, and the old man talked
of the King—“my king.”</p>

<p>“He is only a man,” said Peter, in defense of the
cause.</p>

<p>“Only a man?” said the wood-chopper. “His arms
are like the lion and unicorn—and they have taken
down the King’s arms in Philadelphia and overturned
his statue in New York. But the lion and the unicorn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
still stand on the old State-house, Boston. Hurrah
for King George III! They may do what they will
with me, but my heart will still say: ‘Long live the
King!’”</p>

<p>He seemed to think that the King wore a real lion
and unicorn on his arms, or to so imagine him.</p>

<p>Poor old man on the by-way of the Lebanon cedars!
Peter pitied him, for he felt that he had, after all, a
very human heart.</p>

<p>Dennis went again to the camp of Washington to confer
with the General in regard to movements of powder,
and there he saw Lafayette.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, indeed, did not look like a prophet
now, nor like one of the yeomen of the hill-towns of
Connecticut.</p>

<p>He was in command of the advance guard of Washington’s
army (1780), composed of six battalions of light
artillery. These men glittered in the sun. They did not
look like Connecticut volunteers. The officers were armed
with spontoons and fuses; they wore sabres—French sabres,
presented them by Lafayette. Their banners shone.
Their horses were proud.</p>

<p>“An’ I fear I have missed my prophet that I calculated
him to be,” said Dennis, “and that the
cedar folks will all laugh at me. Prophets do not dash
about in such finery as this. There he comes, sure, on
a spanking horse. I wonder if he would speak to
me now.”</p>

<p>The young Frenchman came dashing by in his regalia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Dennis lifted his hat.</p>

<p>Lafayette halted.</p>

<p>“I came from the cedars—Brother Jonathan’s man,
that I am. You remember <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ovan-saan-tarche</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my hearty friend,” said the Frenchman,
bowing.</p>

<p>“How is his Excellency?”</p>

<p>“Sound in head and heart, and firm in his heels, which
he never turns to his country’s enemies.”</p>

<p>“Have you a wife, my friend?” bowing.</p>

<p>“No, no, but I’ve a sweetheart in old Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Happy man!” bowing.</p>

<p>“But I go my way alone now.”</p>

<p>“Lucky dog!” said the Marquis, with provincial rudeness,
bowing and bowing.</p>

<p>“And there is one question which I wish to ask
you. I have been telling the home people that you
are a prophet, and not much like an old prophet do
you look now—pardon me, your Honor. You once
told me that you carried a secret in your heart that
was to free America. Do you carry that secret
now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my friend, from the cedars. The French
fleet came; that was a part of my secret. But I am carrying
a greater one. You will soon hear the bugles of
Auvergne. When you hear the bugles of Auvergne, then
you will believe that my soul is true to America. Dennis,
let me take your hand.”</p>

<p>He took the Irishman’s hand, bowing.</p>

<p>“There is true blood in that hand,” bowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“There is true blood in yours,” said Dennis, “and the
secret of the skies is in your soul.”</p>

<p>“And there are two crowns in that secret and the
heart of France. And one of the crowns is a woman’s—a
glorious woman’s. Oh, Dennis, you should see our
Queen! She admires Washington, she loves America!”</p>

<p>Dennis dropped down on his knees.</p>

<p>The glittering Frenchman rode away, bowing to the
prostrate man.</p>

<p>“An’ I do believe he is a prophet, after all,” said
Dennis.</p>

<p>It would be great news that he would have to take
back to Lebanon now. How that French prophet bowed
and bowed to him.</p>

<p>His heart rejoiced to bear good news to the Governor.</p>

<p>Peter, as we have said, delighted in bringing the Governor
good news. One day he was sent to Boston for
letters which were expected to arrive from England. One
was given him for the Governor which was marked “Important.”
He hurried back to the war office with it, running
his spirited horse much of the way.</p>

<p>He delivered the letter to the Governor, in the war
office.</p>

<p>“Wait!” said the Governor, as he was about to go.</p>

<p>The Governor read the letter, and then walked around
and around in the little room.</p>

<p>“It is from my son John,” said he. “He has been
arrested in London, and is in prison.” The Governor
continued to walk in the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>John Trumbull had gone abroad in 1780, to study
painting under the great master, Benjamin West. The
British Secretary for American Affairs had assured him
that he would be protected as an artist if he did not
interfere in political affairs.</p>

<p>Colonel Trumbull once thus related the story of his
arrest in a vivid way:</p>

<p>“A thunderbolt falling at my feet would not have
been more astounding; for, conscious of having done nothing
politically wrong, I had become as confident of safety
in London as I should have been in Lebanon. For a few
moments I was perfectly disconcerted, and must have
looked very like a guilty man. I saw, in all its force,
the folly and the audacity of having placed myself at ease
in the lion’s den; but by degrees I recovered my self-possession,
and conversed with Mr. Bond, who waited for
the return of Mr. Tyler until past one o’clock. He then
asked for my papers, put them carefully under cover,
which he sealed, and desired me also to seal; having done
this, he conducted me to a lock-up house, the Brown
Bear in Drury Lane, opposite to the (then) police office.
Here I was locked into a room, in which was a bed, and
a strong, well-armed officer, for the companion of my
night’s meditations or rest. The windows, as well as the
door, were strongly secured by iron bars and bolts, and
seeing no possible means of making my retreat, I yielded
to my fate, threw myself upon the bed, and endeavored
to rest.</p>

<p>“At eleven o’clock the next morning I was guarded
across the street, through a crowd of curious idlers, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
office, and placed in the presence of the three police magistrates—Sir
Sampson Wright, Mr. Addington, and another.
The examination began, and was at first conducted
in a style so offensive to my feelings that it soon
roused me from my momentary weakness, and I suddenly
exclaimed: ‘You appear to have been much more
habituated to the society of highwaymen and pickpockets
than to that of gentlemen. I will put an end
to all this insolent folly by telling you frankly who
and what I am. I am an American—my name is
Trumbull; I am a son of him whom you call the rebel
Governor of Connecticut; I have served in the rebel
American army; I have had the honor of being an
aide-de-camp to him whom you call the rebel General
Washington.’”</p>

<p>He had said too much; he slept that night “in a bed
with a highwayman.”</p>

<p>“This is not your accustomed good news, my boy,”
said the Governor.</p>

<p>“Another ship with letters is soon expected in the
fort,” said Peter. “That may bring good news.”</p>

<p>“Peter, I love the bearer of good news. Go back to
Boston, and if you bring me news to comfort me, it is
well; if not, you will have done your duty. Ride with
the wind!” These were common words of hurry.</p>

<p>Peter rode with the wind. In a few days he returned
on a foaming horse to the war office.</p>

<p>The Governor met him.</p>

<p>“He is released!” said the boy.</p>

<p>The Governor stood with beaming face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>Presently an old man came hobbling up to the door.
It was the wood-chopper.</p>

<p>He looked up to Peter helplessly and yet with a glow
of pride and gratitude.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he said, “I turned you out, but you came
back in my hour of danger. Is there any news from the
King?”</p>

<p>“Yes, uncle.”</p>

<p>“What may it be?”</p>

<p>“He is going to spare John Trumbull’s life and set
him free.”</p>

<p>The old man staggered.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for King George!” he said. “My king!
my king!”</p>

<p>He sunk down on the grass. “My king! my king!”</p>

<p>That the reader may have the exact truth of this bit
of fact-fiction, let me give you the anecdote from history,
that so finely reveals the better side of the character of
the half-insane old King.</p>

<p>Benjamin West, on hearing of the arrest of his pupil,
went directly to the King in Buckingham Palace, and
asked for the young American painter’s release.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for the young man,” said his Majesty
George III, “but he is in the hands of the law, and must
abide the result; I can not interpose. Do you know
whether his parents are living?”</p>

<p>“I think I have heard him say,” replied Mr. West,
“that he has very lately received news of the death of
his mother; I believe his father is living.”</p>

<p>“I pity him from my soul!” exclaimed the King.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
“But, West,” said he, after musing for a few moments,
“go to Mr. Trumbull immediately, and pledge to him
my royal promise, that, <em>in the worst possible event of the
law, his life shall be safe</em>!”</p>

<p>“I pity him from my soul!” The poor King had
a heart to feel. This is the most beautiful anecdote of
King George that we have ever found.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>THE BUGLES BLOW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A high sound of bugles rang out in the still summer
air.</p>

<p>It stopped all feet in the country of the cedars—it
seemed as though the world stopped to listen.</p>

<p>Again the tone filled the summer air—nearer.</p>

<p>The ospreys and crows were flying high in air, down
the odorous way where the bugles were blowing.</p>

<p>Again, and nearer.</p>

<p>Were the bugles those of Rochambeau, who had landed
at Newport, or of a troop of the enemy coming to
surprise the town?</p>

<p>It was a time of expectancy, and also of terror.</p>

<p>Why of terror?</p>

<p>It was known that Rochambeau had landed at Newport,
and was coming to Lebanon—it was in the air. He
would stop at Newport, and it was believed that Washington
would go there to meet him. Washington might
go by way of New London and Lebanon or over the great
turnpike road of Massachusetts and Connecticut; but whatever
way he might take, it was believed that he would
stop in the hidden Connecticut town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>One day a courier had come to the alarm-post.</p>

<p>“Are the ways guarded?” he asked. “There is a plot
to capture Washington if he makes a progress to meet
Rochambeau.”</p>

<p>“Let us go to the war office and consider the matter,”
said the Governor.</p>

<p>“If the matter is serious, I will bring it before the
Committee of Safety.”</p>

<p>They considered the matter. The Governor was
alarmed, and he said to Peter:</p>

<p>“Leave the store and go back to your post on the
by-road.”</p>

<p>The danger at this time is thus treated in Sparks’s Life
of Trumbull:</p>

<p>“Intelligence had come from New York that three
hundred horsemen had crossed over to Long Island and
proceeded eastward, and that boats at the same time had
been sent up the Sound. It was inferred that the party
would pass from Long Island to Connecticut and attempt
to intercept General Washington on his way to
Newport, as it was supposed his intended journey was
known to the enemy. Lafayette suggested that the Duke
de Lauzun should be informed of this movement as soon
as possible, that he might be prepared with his cavalry,
then stationed at Lebanon, to repel the invaders.”</p>

<p>There had landed at Newport with Rochambeau a
most brilliant French officer of cavalry, who was destined
to become the general-in-chief of the Army of the Rhine,
and to lose his head in the French Revolution. It was
the Duke de Lauzun, born in Paris, 1747. He commanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
a force known as Lauzun’s Legion, which consisted
of some six hundred Hussars, with the French enthusiasm
for liberty. They were well equipped, wore
brilliant uniforms, and bore the banners of heroes.</p>

<p>The alarm-post became the seat of numerous orders;
the roads were dusty with hurrying feet.</p>

<p>The people met on the green as soon as the bugles
were heard.</p>

<p>Peter was there. He heard the bugles ring out, and
cried:</p>

<p>“Auvergne! They are the bugles of Auvergne!”</p>

<p>Dennis listened as the air rung merrily.</p>

<p>“Yes, Peter, those are the bugles of Auvergne.”</p>

<p>Faith Trumbull came out and stood on the green beside
Peter.</p>

<p>“Do you think those are the French bugles?” she
asked. “If so, the cause is saved.”</p>

<p>An advance horseman, a Hussar, came riding up the
hill. The bugles blew behind him, now near to the town.</p>

<p>“The Duke is at hand,” said he in French.</p>

<p>The people sank upon their knees.</p>

<p>The Governor heard and stood like a statue on the
green.</p>

<p>“They are coming!” he said. “They are on the way
of victory!”</p>

<p>Six hundred horsemen, glittering in insignia, banners,
and trappings, swept into the town, and their dashing
leader, the Duke de Lauzun, threw up his hand and took
off his hat before the war office. No one had ever dreamed
of a scene like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>The people gathered around him uncovered. The
farmers shouted. Children danced in the natural way;
old men wept.</p>

<p>Dennis approached a French officer who could speak
English.</p>

<p>“An’ have you been blowing the bugles of Auvergne?”
asked he, hat in hand.</p>

<p>“You may well call them so,” said the courtly officer.
“The bugles of Auvergne are the heralds of victory!”</p>

<p>“The cause of liberty in America is won,” said Dennis.
“Lafayette said it would be so when the French bugles
should blow.”</p>

<p>Peter fell down on the green and wept like a child,
saying, over and over: “The bugles of Auvergne! The
bugles of Auvergne!”</p>

<p>It was a glorious day. The very earth seemed to be
glad.</p>

<p>The Hussars sat for a time on their restless horses,
surveying a scene unusual to their eyes. That simple
church was not Notre Dame; the Governor’s house was
not the Tuileries, nor Versailles, nor Marley, nor Saint
Cloud. The green was not the Saint Cloud garden, the
people were not courtiers. Yet their hearts glowed. They
saluted the simple Governor.</p>

<p>Then the bugles blew again—the bugles of Auvergne,
and a great sound rent the air.</p>

<p>The Hussars went to the fields for quarters, and the
Duke followed the Governor into the war office to “consider.”</p>

<p>Washington came to Connecticut in safety. He reviewed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
the army on Lebanon green and at Hartford.
Near Hartford he planned the campaign in Virginia that
was to end the war.</p>


<h3>“AUVERGNE SANS TACHE”—AUVERGNE WITHOUT
A STAIN</h3>

<p>This motto a part of the French soldiers bore proudly
wherever they went. They carried it out of France with
shoutings, and trailed it across the sea. They bore it into
Newport amid booming guns, and to Lebanon amid the
shouts of the heroic farmers. They planted it on Lebanon
green. It should be put to-day among the mottoes
of schools for Flag days and Independence days.</p>

<p>That day of review—it may well rise again in our
fancy!</p>

<p>Spring is in the air. The birds in the woods are
appearing again. There is new light and odors in the
cedars.</p>

<p>The French heroes of Auvergne, the mountaineers,
whose aid Lafayette had sought, assembled on the green.
On one side of the green was the tavern, and on the other
side rose the country village church. The hills everywhere
were renewing their circle of green.</p>

<p>Rochambeau was there with the escutcheon. The
Marquis de Chastellux was probably there—a man of
genius, who wielded the pen of a painter. The gay, and
perhaps profane, Duke de Lauzun was there—he who
laughed at the Governor’s prayers at the table, and who
died many years afterward on the guillotine. Men were
there who had sought the animal delights of the glittering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
palaces of Versailles, Marley, and Saint Cloud. The
heroes were there whose descendants made France a republic.</p>

<p>The sun rose high on the glittering hills. The bugles
sounded again, horses neighed and pranced, uniforms glittered,
and the band filled the air with choral strains.</p>

<p>The simple country folks gathered about the green,
bringing “training-day” ginger-bread, women with knitted
hoods, boys and girls in homespun.</p>

<p>The cedar of Lebanon was there—Governor Trumbull—and
his wife, also, more noble than most of the
stately dames of Trianon.</p>

<p>The American flag arose, and was hailed as the flag of
the future.</p>

<p>A shout for honor went up in which all joined. The
hearts of the French heroes and American heroes were
one. Honor and liberty was the sentiment that ruled the
hour, and here the pioneers of liberty of the two republics
of the future clasped hands.</p>

<p>A glorious day, indeed, was that! Keep it in eternal
memory, O Lebanon hills! Make your old graves a place
of pilgrimages. Sons of the Revolution, have you ever
visited Lebanon?</p>

<p>There came an August night, misty and still. A cloud
covered the hills, and seemed to fall down like a lake on
the cedar swamp. The few distant stars went out.</p>

<p>It lightened—“heat lightning,” as the lightning without
thunder was called in the old New England villages.</p>

<p>The turnpike road was silent. There were no sounds
of night-birds in the deep cedar swamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Peter, the shepherd-boy, stood behind his window light
in silence under a cedar that spread itself like a tent.
The tree gathered mist and shed it like rain. He had
put a mask in the window, for fear of a shot, in case
of danger.</p>

<p>“Nothing to-night,” he said.</p>

<p>But what was that?</p>

<p>A dead twig of a tree broke under a foot.</p>

<p>He started and moved behind the window toward the
highway.</p>

<p>Another twig snapped.</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” he called.</p>

<p>“A friend.”</p>

<p>“Give the countersign.”</p>

<p>“Groton,” said the voice.</p>

<p>“Wrong,” said the lad. “Follow the window, but
keep at a distance, for you are my prisoner.”</p>

<p>It lightened. The lad saw the man, and that he was
no ordinary traveler.</p>

<p>The lad moved back. The traveler followed, and presently
said:</p>

<p>“Hello! where am I?”</p>

<p>“A prisoner; follow me.”</p>

<p>“But the house moves.”</p>

<p>“Follow me—you are in my power.”</p>

<p>It lightened again.</p>

<p>The flash disclosed that the traveler had drawn a pistol.</p>

<p>“It is useless for you to use weapons,” said Peter;
“you are in my power.”</p>

<p>There was a crack in the air. A pistol-shot struck the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
mask in the window and broke it. Then all was darkness
and silence.</p>

<p>“Follow me,” said the lad. “Your shot was vain.
You are a traitor, and you are in my power. I could
take your life in a minute. Follow me.”</p>

<p>“But your house moves,” said the man in a voice that
trembled.</p>

<p>He may have had a brave heart, but few brave men
at that time were proof against the terrors of superstition.
The man evidently believed that he was in the power
of some evil spirit.</p>

<p>There was another lightning flash. The man had
turned.</p>

<p>“Follow me,” said the lad, “or you are a dead man.”</p>

<p>“Will you spare me if I will follow?” asked the adventurer.</p>

<p>“Follow me until I tell you to stop, and I will be your
friend if you speak fair.”</p>

<p>The steps followed the moving window at a distance.
Suddenly they went down, and there arose a cry as of
a penned animal. The man had fallen into a cave.</p>

<p>The moving window went up the hill in sight of the
alarm-post, and then the light went out.</p>

<p>Peter went down in the darkness to the rescue of the
fallen stranger.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“In the cave.”</p>

<p>“In the cave of the magazine?”</p>

<p>The stranger had asked the question in an unguarded
moment of terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“You are a spy, and were seeking for the magazines,”
said the boy. “I know your heart. Let me
help you out, and come with me to the shelter of the
cedars.”</p>

<p>Peter took the stranger’s hand, and led him by flashes
of lightning to a covert under the cedars. Some crows
cawed in the darkness above.</p>

<p>The two sat down.</p>

<p>“You are in my power,” said Peter.</p>

<p>“Then you must be the Evil One. Why am I in your
power more than you in mine? Do you live in a house
that travels? Where has your house gone?”</p>

<p>“Tell me, now, who you are,” said Peter.</p>

<p>“I am a traveler.”</p>

<p>“Why did you give me a false countersign?”</p>

<p>“To put you off so that I might go on.”</p>

<p>“Who are you seeking?”</p>

<p>“I was going to the war office.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“To see the Governor.”</p>

<p>“But why did you say ‘magazine’?”</p>

<p>“I deal in saltpeter.”</p>

<p>The clouds were lifting. The great cedars seemed to
shudder now and then as a faint breeze stole through them.
Then the full moon rolled out. The crows flapped away
from the place when they heard voices.</p>

<p>“Let us go,” said the man. “For what are you waiting?”</p>

<p>There was a sound of horses’ feet. Dennis had seen
the signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“Who is coming?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“The guard.”</p>

<p>“So you have entrapped me. Where is the house?”</p>

<p>“There was none.”</p>

<p>Dennis and two men rode up.</p>

<p>“This man,” said Peter, “is a spy; he has given a
false countersign, and is looking for magazines.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Dennis, with a leveled
musket.</p>

<p>“I am your prisoner,” said the man, “and more is the
pity. I have been tricked. I followed a window; it is
gone.”</p>

<p>“Stranger, no trifling,” said Dennis. “What brought
you here? If you will tell me the truth, I will befriend
you as far as I can. But listen: you have no hope of
anything outside of my friendly heart, and I am one of
the guard of the first of patriots in the land. I am an
Irishman, but I am loyal to America. Tell me the truth—what
brought you here?”</p>

<p>“You speak true when you say that I have no hope
but in your heart, and I am inclined to tell you all.”</p>

<p>Dennis and the two men whom he had brought with
him dismounted, and sat down under the cedars, through
which the moon shone.</p>

<p>“I was led here through the suggestion of a bad example.
We are led by the imagination. Imagination
follows suggestion. Benedict Arnold went over to the
cause of the King, and he is a power now. I once served
under Arnold. It was in the northern campaign. I will
acknowledge all. I am seeking to do him a service—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
find out where your powder magazines are stored. Arnold
will soon be thundering off this coast!”</p>

<p>Dennis started.</p>

<p>“What! in Connecticut?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in Connecticut.”</p>

<p>“Among his own kin?”</p>

<p>“Among his own kin.”</p>

<p>“Black must be the heart of a man that would fall
upon his own neighborhood. Such a heart must be born
wrong. They say that he liked to torture animals when
he was a boy. Man, what do you know? Remember the
fate of André.”</p>

<p>The man suddenly recollected it. He began to shake,
for with the rising of the moon and the clearing of the
air it was cool.</p>

<p>“I know not where I am,” said he. “Everything is
strange. But let me talk to you in confidence.</p>

<p>“I have money.”</p>

<p>He took out a purse, and jingled some coin.</p>

<p>“Let me go and I will pay you. Here, take this.”
He extended the purse toward Dennis. “Let me go back
and you shall have it all.”</p>

<p>“Man,” said Dennis, “André offered gold to his captors,
and tried to bribe them to let him go. Put up thy
gold. There is money that does not enrich. I would
not betray the cause of liberty in America and the great
heart of Jonathan Trumbull for all the gold of Peru.
Tell me now your whole heart, or I take you to the
alarm-post, to be shot as a spy.”</p>

<p>The man shook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“Well, here is my confession. I hoped to find the
secret places of the magazines where the powder that
supplies the army is hidden, and to report to Arnold.
This is the whole truth. I am sorry for what I
planned. I would not do so again. Now I ask your
mercy.”</p>

<p>“To Arnold, did you say? Where did you expect to
meet Arnold?”</p>

<p>“On the coast—it might be at New London or
Groton.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Soon.”</p>

<p>“Soon, soon. Peter, set the beacon on the hill!”</p>

<p>The boy ran; a light streamed up. Dennis hurried
with his prisoner to the alarm-post.</p>

<p>The prisoner knew not what to make of that night
when windows moved and a shot that shattered a head
did not kill, and the heavens flamed before the nimble
feet of a boy.</p>

<p>Had he been drawn into a witch’s cave? What had
led him to disclose the secret? He thought of André,
and when he was led into the guard-house he sat down,
wondered, and wept.</p>

<p>But he hoped Dennis, his captor, had a human heart.
Was he a second André?</p>

<p>Dennis went to the guard-house the next day to visit
a new prisoner. The suggestions that the latter made
were most alarming.</p>

<p>If Benedict Arnold was to make attack along the coast
his object was to divide the American army, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
now moving south for the great Virginia campaign against
Cornwallis.</p>

<p>“It would be like the British to strike us now upon
the coast,” said the Governor, “but he would be more
than a traitor who would slaughter his own kin on the
soil where he was born and bred.”</p>

<p>The man gave his name as Ayre; probably from the
suggestion of the name of the British colonel who was
under Arnold.</p>

<p>He was despondent, and sat in the guard-house with
drooping head.</p>

<p>“Of what are you thinking?” asked Dennis. “You
may give me your thoughts with safety. The Governor
is the soul of honor, and he will not cause me to violate
the spirit of my promise that I have made.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking of the moment when the captors of
André said to him, ‘We must take off your boots.’”</p>

<p>For in the boots of the unfortunate officer were the
despatches from Arnold offering to treacherously surrender
West Point.</p>

<p>“That moment must have stricken terror to André’s
heart,” said the man. “Then it was that he saw the whole
of life. Your Governor seems to be a very kind-hearted
man—the people love him. I am sorry that I ever had
evil thoughts of him. But, my friend, send me away; for
should a fleet descend upon the coast, the hatred of all
these people will fall upon me. The man who suggests
an evil that comes is held in detestation. I would not be
safe here.”</p>

<p>“You are right, and you shall be sent to Boston.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>It was in the air that the Connecticut coast was to
be attacked again. Connecticut must be defended by her
own people, should it come, for it would not do to divide
the American army in its great movement to crush the
main army of the British of the south.</p>

<p>“I will send you, with the Governor’s approval, to
Fort Trumbull, at New London, and I will accompany
you there myself,” decided Dennis.</p>

<p>It was the 6th of November when the two set out on
horseback for New London and Groton—a bright, glimmering
day, the wayside bordered with goldenrod. The
meadows were clouded with the aftermath and webby
wild grasses, and seemed to sing with insects.</p>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>Boom! Boom!</p>

<p>“There is a cannonade going on at New London,”
said Dennis.</p>

<p>They hurried on.</p>

<p>The air thundered.</p>

<p>“It is Arnold!” said the prisoner.</p>

<p>As they passed down their way amid cidery orchards,
they began to meet people flying with terror.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” asked Dennis.</p>

<p>“Arnold!” was the answer of one. “He is burning
everything—the streets that he trod in his boyhood, the
very houses that sheltered him. He is standing on the
hill, glass in hand, gloating in the power to kill his own
neighbors’ sons. Oh, is it possible that one should come
to kill his own!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>As they went on, the cannonading grew louder and
the roads presented a scene such as had hardly ever been
witnessed in America before.</p>

<p>The people were flying with their goods: women on
beds on the backs of horses; old women driving cows before
them; boys with sheep; men in carts, with valuables;
dogs who had lost their masters.</p>

<p>They met one scene that was indeed pitiful. It was
a man hurrying with the coffin of a child on his back
toward the burying-ground. He must bury the little one
as he fled.</p>

<p>The farmhouses were full of people with white faces,
people who crowded upon each other.</p>

<p>It was a terrible story that they had to tell. Arnold
had surprised New London by the sea, and had burned
down every house, even the houses that sheltered him
in his boyhood.</p>

<p>But the destruction of New London was a light
event compared to the horrors of Groton, across the
river.</p>

<p>They found that Colonel Ayre had attacked Fort Griswold,
and was slaughtering the men after they had surrendered.
Arnold had sent a messenger to arrest this
slaughter, but the latter had arrived too late. The garrison
had refused to surrender. When, at last, they were
compelled to yield, they were put to the sword without
mercy, and the wounded were killed, and even the dead
were maltreated. The men under Colonel Ayre had become
human fiends. They had gone mad with the passion
for killing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>One of the British officers ran from place to place to
restrain the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” said he. “In the name of heaven, I
say stop—I can not endure it!”</p>

<p>But the work of killing went on, and of killing the
wounded and stabbing the dead.</p>

<p>Night fell. The British set a bomb to the magazine
and passed up the river, expecting to see a terrible explosion
that would fire the heavens. But the explosion
did not come. A brave band of Americans had extinguished
the fuse.</p>

<p>“There is no Fort Trumbull to which I can take you
now,” said Dennis to his prisoner. “You may go to
your own.”</p>

<p>“Then I will return with you, and you will never
find a heart more true to your Governor than mine will
be. Christ forgave Peter, and was not Peter true? Our
truest friends are those whom we forgive. To know all
is to forgive all. I know your Governor now. I once
hated him; he is led by the spirit of the living God, and
I would die for a man like that. It is better to change
the heart of an enemy than to kill him. Let me follow
you back, and the people will receive my repentance even
at this awful hour.”</p>

<p>Dennis, through fear of his safety, left him outside of
Lebanon at a farmhouse, but when he had told his tale
to the people, they said:</p>

<p>“Bring him back; he is another man now.”</p>

<small>A DAUGHTER OF THE PILGRIMS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was past midsummer—the shadow of change was
in the year. The birds were gathering in flocks in the
rowened meadows, and the woods were displaying their
purple grapes and first red leaves.</p>

<p>Rochambeau had been receiving the hospitalities of
the Governor, and had also received lessons in the new
school of liberty from Faith Robinson Trumbull, the wife
of the Governor. The hero of Minden had come to see
this grand woman, and wished to make her a present
before he marched on to join the army of Washington
against Clinton, with his six thousand heroes.</p>

<p>What should his present to this noble woman be?</p>

<p>He had among his effects a scarlet cloak. It was
suitable for a woman or for a man. It covered the whole
form, and made the wearer conspicuous, for it was made
of fine fabric, and represented the habit of the battle-field.</p>

<p>He took the cloak out of his treasures one evening
and came down into the public room of the forest inn,
where some of the French officers of the regiment of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i> were seated in a merry mood before
the newly kindled fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>He held up the scarlet cloak. “Here,” said he, “is
a garment to be worn after the war for liberty is over.
A field-marshal might wear it after the day of victory.
This war will soon end; I am going to present this cloak
to one of the most patriotic souls that I have ever met.
Who do you think it is?”</p>

<p>“The Governor,” said an officer, a colonel; “Washington’s
own ‘Brother Jonathan.’ He has made himself
poor by the war, but has been the inspiration of every
battle-field, so they say. Well, you do well to honor the
rustic Governor. The world is richer for him. That is
a good thought, General. You honor the soldiers of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i>.”</p>

<p>The General, the hero of Lafeldt, held up the cloak
before the cooling summer fire. A soldier turned a burning
stick with iron tongs, and flames with sparks like a
little volcano shot up and threw a red gleam on the scarlet
cloak with its gold thread.</p>

<p>“You have made a wrong guess, Colonel,” said Rochambeau.
“This cloak is for Madam Faith Trumbull,
who has the blood of Robinson of Leyden in her veins,
and who is the very spirit of liberty.”</p>

<p>Immediately the officers leaped to their feet.</p>

<p>“Cheers!” said the Colonel. “Cheers for Madam
Faith—may she soon wear the cloak—after the war!”</p>

<p>The soldiers of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i> were chivalrous,
and they swung their arms in wheel-like circles and cheered
for the wife of the self-forgetful Governor.</p>

<p>In the midst of this enthusiastic outpouring of feeling
the Governor himself appeared in the reception-room of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
the forest inn with madam, smiling and stately, on his
arm.</p>

<p>“You came at a happy moment, Governor,” said Rochambeau.
“I am showing my men this scarlet cloak.”</p>

<p>“It is a fine garment,” said the Governor. “It were
worthy of a field-marshal of France.”</p>

<p>“Would it be worthy of the wife of a marshal of a
regiment of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i>?” asked the courtly
Frenchman.</p>

<p>“It would,” said the Governor in a New England
tone.</p>

<p>“Then it would be worthy of <em>your</em> wife, Governor.”</p>

<p>Rochambeau approached Madam Faith. “Will you
allow me, madam, to honor you, if it be an honor, with
the scarlet cloak? I wish you to wear it in memory of
the soldiers of Auvergne, and of your humble servant,
until you shall find some one who is more worthy of it—and
I do not believe, madam, if you will allow me to
say it, that any heart truer than yours to the principles
of liberty and to all mankind beats in these provinces.”</p>

<p>He placed the scarlet cloak over her shoulders, and
the officers shouted for madam, for the Governor, for
Rochambeau, and for the soldiers of the banner of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne
sans tache</i>.</p>

<p>How noble, indeed, Madam Faith looked as she stood
there in the scarlet cloak, its gold threads glimmering in
the first firelight!</p>

<p>Her face glowed. She tried to speak, but could only
say: “My heart is full, General. But any soldier who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
sleeps to-night on the battle-field is nobler than I—my
heart would cover him with this cloak.”</p>

<p>The officers shouted enthusiastically: “Auvergne!”</p>

<p>The Governor stood off from his wife and her dazzling
garment.</p>

<p>“You do look real pretty, Faith—wear it in memory
of the French—wear it to church—your wearing it will
honor the cause, and be a service to liberty. I wish Washington
could see you now.”</p>

<p>“I will wear it,” said Madam Faith. “My heart
thanks you!” she said to Rochambeau. She began to
retreat from the room, her face almost as red as the
cloak, and her eyes bright with tears. “I thank you in
the name of Liberty!” She moved farther away and out
of the door.</p>

<p>“Going, Faith?” asked the Governor.</p>

<p>There came back a voice—“God bless you!”—the
scarlet cloak had gone. She thought that it was unworthy
of her to remain where she would secure homage, when
the Connecticut soldiers had had scarcely clothes to wear
in their march against Clinton in the midst of the poverty
that had befallen the colonies during the war.</p>

<p>She became greatly distressed. In her enthusiasm for
the French deliverers she had promised to wear the cloak
until some one more worthy of it could be found, some
one who needed it more.</p>

<p>She took off the garment in her own room and sat
down. She thought of the past. She saw in her vision
her godly ancestor, Robinson, addressing the Pilgrim
Fathers for the last time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“Go ye into the wilderness,” he had said, “and new
light shall break out from the word. I will follow you.”</p>

<p>She saw in fancy the Mayflower sail away, lifting
new horizons. She saw the many Pilgrims’ graves amid
the May flowers after the first winter at Plymouth.</p>

<p>She rose and put on the cloak and stood before the
glass.</p>

<p>“I can not wear it,” she said. “I must wear only
the clothes made with my own hands, in times like these.”</p>

<p>She looked into the glass again.</p>

<p>“But my promise?” she asked. “I must keep that—I
must be worthy of the confidence that these soldiers
of liberty have given me. I must honor Rochambeau and
the soldiers of the land of Pascal. How shall I do it?
I will wear it once and then seek some one more worthy
to wear it; he will not be hard to find.”</p>

<p>Governor Trumbull had become famous for his Fast-Day
and Thanksgiving proclamations. His words in these
documents had the fire of an ancient prophet.</p>

<p>This year his proclamation sang and rang. He called
upon the people to assemble in their meeting-house, and
to bring with them everything that they could spare that
could be made useful to the soldiers on the battle-field and
be laid upon the altar of sacrifice.</p>

<p>Madam Faith heard his message as the pastor read it
from the tall pulpit under the sounding-board.</p>

<p>She thought of the scarlet cloak. She must wear it to
the church on that great day to honor Rochambeau and
the soldiers of Auvergne. But of what use could her
garment be to the soldiers in the stress of war?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>It was a bright mid-autumn day. The people were
gathering on the harvest-laden plateau on Lebanon Hill.
The church on the high green, founded some eighty years
before, opened its doors to the sun. The yeomen gathered
on its steps and looked down on the orchards and
harvest fields. The men of the great farms assembled
in groups about the inn and talked of the fortunes of the
war. They were rugged men in homespun dress, with
the purpose of the time in their faces. The women, too,
were in homespun.</p>

<p>While groups of people were gathering here and there
the door of the Governor’s plain house opened, and in
it appeared Madam Faith in her scarlet cloak. All eyes
were turned upon her. She stepped out on to the green.
She did not look like the true daughter of the Pilgrims
that she was! The gay and glittering garment did not
become the serious purpose in her face.</p>

<p>She waited outside the door, and was soon joined by
the Governor. The two approached the church under the
gaze of many eyes, and entered the building, which is
to-day in appearance much as it was then, and the people
followed them. The chair in which Governor Trumbull
sat in church is still to be seen in the old Trumbull
house. A colored picture of the church as it then appeared,
with its high pulpit, sounding-board and galleries,
may be seen in Stuart’s “Life of Trumbull.”</p>

<p>A silence fell upon the assembly. The people felt
that the crisis of the war had passed with the coming
of Rochambeau, but the manner of the issue was yet
doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>The minister arose—“Be still, and know that I am
the Lord.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“God is the refuge of His saints,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Though storms of sharp distress invade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Before they utter their complaints</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Behold Him present with their aid!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The stanza, or a like one, was sung in a firm tone, such
as only times like these could inspire. The heroic quality
sank into tuneful reverence with the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is a stream whose gentle flow</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Supplies the city of our God,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">or a like paraphrase. A long prayer followed; the hour-glass
was turned—silence in the full pews!</p>

<p>The sermon followed in the silence. Then the minister
made an appeal which went to every heart.</p>

<p>“The nation stands waiting the Divine will. We have
given to the cause our sons, our harvests, the increase of
our flocks. We have sent of our substance, our best, to
every northern battle-field. We have seen our men go
forth, and they come not back. We have seen our cattle
driven away, and our cribs and cellars left empty; we
have heard our Governor called a ‘brother’ by the noble
Washington, and the glorious regiment of France’s honor
has sung amid these cedars the songs of Auvergne.</p>

<p>“But the trumpets of the northern winds are sounding,
and our army faces winter again, cloakless and some of
them shoeless, in tatters. We are making new garments
for the soldiers, but we have no red stripes to put upon
them; we may not honor the noblest soldier in the world
with any uniform, or insignia of his calling. He goes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
forth in homespun, and in homespun he faces the glittering
foe, and falls. His honor is in himself, and not in
his garments. He courageously goes down to the chambers
of silence without stripe or star.”</p>

<p>At the words <em>red stripes</em>, all eyes, as by one impulse,
turned to the scarlet cloak. It would furnish the ornament
of dignity and honor to a score of uniforms.</p>

<p>“Women of Lebanon, you have with willing hands
laid much on the altar of liberty. Under the pulpit stands
a rail that guards holy things. I appeal to you once more—I
hope that it may be for the last time—to spare all
you can for the help and comfort of the soldier. Come
up to the altar one by one and put your offerings inside
of the rail, and I will lift my hands over your sacrifices
in prayer and benediction.”</p>

<p>Silence. A few women began to remove the rings
from their fingers and ears. One woman was seen to
loosen her Rob Roy shawl. Two Indian girls removed
strings of wampum from their necks. But no one rose.
All seemed waiting.</p>

<p>The Governor sat in his chair, and beside him his good
wife in the red Rochambeau cloak. They were in the
middle aisle.</p>

<p>Madam Trumbull was thinking. Could she offer the
scarlet garment to the cause without implying a want of
gratitude toward the noble Rochambeau?</p>

<p>Would she not <em>honor</em> Rochambeau by offering the gift
to the camp and battle-field?</p>

<p>“Stripes on the soldiers’ garments are inspirations,”
she may have whispered to her husband. “I am going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
to give my cloak—it shall follow Rochambeau—I am going
to make it live and march—<em>he</em> shall see it again in the
lines that dare death. Shall I go to the altar?”</p>

<p>“Yes, go. Send your cloak to Rochambeau again. Let
it move on the march. You will honor the regiment of
Auvergne—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i>.”</p>

<p>She rose, almost trembling. Every eye was fixed upon
her. Madam Faith was held in more than common esteem,
not only because she was the wife of the Governor, but
also because she was a descendant of the <em>Prophet</em> of the
Pilgrims of Leyden and Plymouth.</p>

<p>She stood by the Governor’s chair, unfastening the
red garment. The people saw what she was about to do.
Some of them bowed their heads; some wept.</p>

<p>The pastor spoke: “I would that the Pilgrim, John
Robinson, were here to-day!”</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp223">Madam Faith</a> removed the cloak and laid it over her
arm. She bent her face on the floor, and slowly walked
toward the rail that guarded the sacred things of the simple
altar.</p>

<p>The pastor lifted his hands.</p>

<p>“Pray ye all for the principle of the right, for the
cause of the soldier of liberty.”</p>

<p>She <a href="#i_fp223">laid the scarlet cloak</a> on the altar, and turned to
the people and lifted her eyes to God.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_223">Madam Faith Trumbull contributing her scarlet cloak to the

  </div>
</div>

<p>She looked like a divinity as she stood forth there
that day, like a spirit that had come forth from the
Mayflower.</p>

<p>That Thanksgiving was long remembered in Lebanon.
That cloak was turned into stripes on soldiers’ uniforms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
and made history, and some of the uniforms bearing them
are yet to be seen.</p>

<p>To Dennis and Peter was entrusted the sending of the
new uniforms with the red stripes to the army gathering
around Yorktown. The faithful Irishman and the lad
rode away from the alarm-post in the cedars amid the
cheers of the people. What news would they bring back
when they should return?</p>

<p>It was an anxious time in the cedars. In the evenings
the people gathered about the war office and at the
Alden Inn. A stage-driver, who was a natural story-teller,
used to relate curious stories at the latter place, on
the red settle there, and in these silent days of moment
the people hugged the fire to hear him: it was their only
amusement.</p>

<p>One evening a country elder, who had done a noble
work in his day, stopped at the tavern. This event brought
the Governor over to the place, and the elder was asked
to relate a story of his parish on the red settle. He had
a sense of humor as keen as Peters, who was still telling
strange tales in England of the people that he had found
in the “new parts.”</p>

<p>Let us give you one of the parson’s queer stories: it
pictures the times.</p>


<h3>THE COURTING STICK</h3>

<p>Asenath Short—I seem to see her now (said the
elder). One day she said to her husband:</p>

<p>“Kalub, now look here; we’ve got near upon everything
so far as this world’s goods go—spinnin’ wheels and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
hatchels, and looms and a mahogany table, and even a
board to be used to lay us out on when the final time shall
come. The last thing that you bought was a dinner-horn,
and then I put away the conch shell from the Indies along
with the cradle and the baby chair. But, Kalub, there’s
one thing more that we will have to have. The families
down at Longmeadow have all got them; they save fire
and fuel, and they enable the young folks and their elders
all to talk together at the same time, respectfully in the
same room, and when the young folks have a word to say
to each other in private it encourages them. Now I’m
kind o’ sociable-like myself, and I like to encourage young
people; that’s why I wanted you to buy a spinet for Mandy.
I don’t like to see young folks go apart by themselves,
especially in winter; there is no need of extra lights or
fires, if one only has one of <em>them</em> things.”</p>

<p>“One of them things? Massy sakes alive, what is it,
Asenath?”</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you never seen one, Kalub? It is a
courtin’ stick. They didn’t used to have such things when
we were young. A courtin’ stick is like Aaron’s rod that
budded.”</p>

<p>“A courtin’ stick! Conquiddles! Do I hear my ears?
There don’t need to be any machinery for courtin’ in
this world no more than there does to make the avens
bloom, or the corn cockles to come up in the corn. What
is a courtin’ stick, Asenath?”</p>

<p>“Well, Kalub, a courtin’ stick is a long, hollow wooden
tube, with a funnel at each end—one funnel to cover the
mouth of the one that speaks, and one to cover the ear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
of the one that listens. By that stick—it is all so proper
and handy when it works well and steady—young people
can talk in the same room, and not disturb the old people
or set the work folks and the boys to titterin’ as they used
to do when we were young. It was discovered here in
the Connecticut Valley, which has always been a place of
providences. Just as I said, it is a savin’ of fire and
lights in the winter-time, and it suggests the right relations
among families of property. It is a sort of guide-post
to life.</p>

<p>“Kalub, don’t you want that I should show you one?”</p>

<p>“Where did you get it, Asenath?”</p>

<p>“Asahel made it for me. I told him how to make it,
but when I came to explain to him what it was for his
face fell, and he turned red and he said, ‘Hyppogriffo!’
I wonder where he got that word—‘hyppogriffo!’ It has
a pagan sound; Asahel, he mistrusted.”</p>

<p>“Mistrusted what, Asenath?”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t told you quite all. When the head
of a family knows that a certain young man is comin’
to visit him at a certain time and hangs up a courtin’ stick
over the mantel-tree shelf, or the dresser, it is a sign to
the visitor he is welcome.”</p>

<p>“But there is no need of a sign like that, Asenath.”</p>

<p>Asenath rose, went into the spare bed-room, a place
of the mahogany bureau, the mourning piece, valences and
esconces, and brought out a remarkable looking tube, which
seemed to have leather ears at each end, and which was
some dozen feet long.</p>

<p>“Moses!” said Caleb, “and all the patriarchs!” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
added. “Let’s you and me try it. There, you put it
up to your ear and let me speak. Is the result satisfyin’?”</p>

<p>Asenath assured him that the experiment was quite
satisfactory.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Caleb. “Now I will go on shellin’
corn and think matters over; it may be all right if the
elder says it is.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes there was a rain of corn into the
basket, when Caleb started up and said, “Cracky!” He
put his hand into one pocket after another, then went up
to the peg board and took down his fur overcoat and felt
of the pockets in it. He came back to the place of the
corn-shelling doubtfully, and began to trot, as it were,
around the basket, still putting his hand into one pocket
after another.</p>

<p>“Lost anything, Kalub?” asked Asenath.</p>

<p>“Yes, the stage-driver gave me a parcel directed to
Asahel, in the care of Amanda, and I don’t know what I
did with it. I meant to have told you about it, but you
set me all into confusion over that there courtin’ stick.”</p>

<p>We know not how many old New England homesteads
may have a courting stick among their heirlooms, but imagine
that they are few. Such a stick used to be shown
to the curious in the Longmeadow neighborhood of Springfield,
Mass., and we think it may be seen there still. It
was especially associated with the manners and customs of
the Connecticut Valley towns, and it left behind it some
pleasing legends in such pastoral villages as Northampton,
Hadley, and Hatfield. It was a promising object-lesson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
in the domestic life of the worldly wise, and could have
been hardly unwelcome to marmlet maidens and rustic
beaux.</p>

<p>Caleb Short continued his shelling corn for a time, but
he worked slowly. He at last turned around and looked
at his wife, who was sewing rags for a to-be-braided mat.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it now, Kalub?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>“Asahel.”</p>

<p>“Yes—I know—I’ve been thinkin’ much about him of
late. He came to us as a bound boy after his folks were
dead, and we’ve done well by him, now haven’t we, Kalub?
I’ve set store by him, but—I might as well speak it out,
he’s too sociable with our Mandy now that they have
grown up. It stands to reason that he can never marry
Mandy.”</p>

<p>“Why not, Asenath?”</p>

<p>“Why not? How would you like to have people say
that our Amanda had married her father’s hired man?
How would it look on our family tree?” Asenath glanced
up to a fruitful picture on the wall.</p>

<p>“Asahel is a true-hearted boy,” said Caleb. “Since
our own son has taken to evil ways, who will we have to
depend upon in our old age but Asahel, unless Mandy
should marry?”</p>

<p>“O Kalub, think what a wife I’ve been to you and
listen to me. Mandy <em>is</em> going to marry. I am going to
invite Myron Smith here on Thanksgiving, and to hang
up the courtin’ stick over the dresser, so that he will see
it plain. That stick is goin’ to jine the two farms. It is
a yard-stick—there, now, there! I always was great on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
calculation; Abraham was, and so was Jacob; it’s scriptural.
You would have never proposed to me if I hadn’t
encouraged you, and only think what a wife I’ve been to
you! Just like two wives.”</p>

<p>“But Asahel Bow is a thrifty boy. He is sensible and
savin’, and he is feelin’.”</p>

<p>“Kalub, Kalub Short, now that will do. Who was
his father? Who but old Seth Bow? Everybody knows
what he was, and blood will tell. Just think of what that
man did!”</p>

<p>“What, Asenath?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know that he undertook to preach, and he
thought that if he opened his mouth the Lord would fill it.
And he opened his mouth, and stood with it open for
nearly ten minutes, and he couldn’t speak a word. He
was a laughing-stock, and he never went to meetin’ much
after that, only to evenin’ meetin’s in the schoolhouse—candle-light
meetin’s.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Asenath, that is all true. But Seth Bow was an
honest man. Just hear how he used to talk to me. He
used to say to me—I often think of it—he used to say:
‘Caleb Short, I’ve lost my standin’ among the people, but
I haven’t lost my faith in God, and there is a law that
makes up for things. I couldn’t preach, but Asahel is
goin’ to preach. He’s inherited the germ of intention from
me, and one day that will be something to be thankful for,
come Thanksgiving days. I will preach through Asahel
yet. I tell you, Caleb, there is a law that makes up for
things. No good intention was ever lost. One must do
right, and then believe that all that happens to him is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
for his good. That is the way the Book of Job reads, and
I have faith, faith, faith! You may all laugh at me, but
Asahel will one day be glad that his old father wanted
to preach, and tried, even if he did fail. The right intention
of the father is fulfilled in the son, and I tell you
there’s a law that makes up for things, and so I can sing
Thanksgiving Psalms with the rest of um, if I don’t dare
to open my mouth in doin’ it.’ Asenath, I look upon
Asahel as a boy that is blessed in the intention of his
father. The right intentions of a boy live in the man,
and the gov’nin’ purpose of the man lives in his boys or
those whom he influences, and I tell you, Asenath, there’s
nothing better to be considered on Thanksgiving days than
the good intentions of the folks of the past that live in
us. There are no harvests in the world ekul to those.
You wait and see.”</p>

<p>At this point of the story, the clergyman said:</p>

<p>“That is good old Connecticut doctrine, Brother Jonathan.”</p>

<p>The story-teller continued:</p>

<p>The weather-door slowly opened, and the tall form of
a young man appeared.</p>

<p>“Asahel,” said Asenath, “we were just speakin’ of
you and your folks, and now I want to have a talk with
you. Take off your frock, and don’t be standing there
like a swamp crane, but sit down on the uniped here close
by me, as you used to do when you was a small boy. I
set store by you, and you just think what a mother I’ve
been to you since your own mother was laid away in the
juniper lot! But I am a proper plain-speakin’ woman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
as your own mother was—she that answered the minister
back in meetin’ time when the good old elder said that
your father was a hypocrit.”</p>

<p>Presently the weather-door opened, and Amanda appeared
and sat down on the same uniped with Asahel.</p>

<p>The good woman continued:</p>

<p>“You two have been cowslippin’ together, and sassafrassin’
together, and a-huntin’ turkeys’ nests and wild
honey, and pickin’ Indian pipe and all. Now, that was
all right when you were children. But, Asahel, you and
Amanda have come to the pastur’ bars of life, and you
must part, and you, Asahel, must be content to become
just one of our hired men and sit at the table with the
other hired men, on Thanksgivin’ days the same as on all
other days, and not stand in the way of any one. And,
Amandy Short, do you see that?”</p>

<p>Asenath held up the courting stick.</p>

<p>“Do you know what that is?”</p>

<p>“It is just a hollow stick. I’ve seen sticks before.
What does all this mean?”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen sticks before, have you, Amanda? And
you have experienced ’em, too, for I have been a faithful
mother to you—as good as two. But this is the stick
that must unite some farm to ours, and I am goin’ to
hang it up over the dresser, and when the right young
man comes, Amanda, I want you to take it down and
put it up to your ear, so, and it may be that you will
hear somethin’ useful, somethin’ to your advantage and
ourn. I hope that I made myself clearly understood.”</p>

<p>She did. The two young people had not been left in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
any darkness at all in regard to her solution of their social
equation. Asahel stepped into the middle of the great
kitchen floor. His face was as fixed as an image, and the
veins were mapped on his forehead.</p>

<p>He bent his eyes on Asenath for a moment and then
his soul flowed out to the tone of the accompaniment of
honor.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Short, you were good to me as a boy, and I will
never do a thing against your will in your family affairs.
My father prayed that I might have the ability to fulfil
what he was unable to do in life. To inherit such a
purpose from such a father is something to be grateful
for, and now that I am disappointed in my expectation
of Amanda I shall devote all that I am to my father’s
purpose in me. I am going to be a minister.”</p>

<p>“You be, hey? But where is the money comin’
from?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Short, it is to come out of these two fists.”</p>

<p>Poor tender-hearted Caleb, he shelled corn as never
before during this painful scene. Suddenly he looked up
and about for relief. His eye fell upon the courting
stick.</p>

<p>“Here,” said he to Amanda, who was crying, “just
let us try this new comical machine, and see how it
works. Mandy, let’s you and I have a little talk together.
I’ll put the thing up to my mouth, so, and you just listen
at the other end of it. There—I’m going to say something.
Ready now, Mandy? Did you hear that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, I heard it just as plain as though you
spoke it into my ear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“<em>You</em> didn’t hear anything in particular, did you,
Asenath?”</p>

<p>“No, only a sound far away and mysterious like.”</p>

<p>“Curis, ain’t it, how that thing will convey sound in
that way? I should think that some invention might come
out of it some day. Now, Amanda, you just put your
ear up to the funnel and listen again. Mandy,” he
continued through the tube, “if your heart is sot on Asahel,
do you stand by him, and wait; time makes changes
pleasantly.” He put aside the tube. “There, now, do
you hear?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hear, mother, did you?” said Caleb to
Asenath, glancing aside.</p>

<p>“No, Kalub.”</p>

<p>“This is a great invention. It works well. Now
let me just have a word with Asahel.”</p>

<p>Amanda conveyed one end of the tube to Asahel’s
ear.</p>

<p>“Asahel.” He took his mouth from the tube. “Did
you hear?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hear anything, did you?” he said, looking
toward Asenath.</p>

<p>“No, Kalub.”</p>

<p>“Now, Asahel, you listen again,” said Caleb, putting
his mouth to the tube. “If your heart is sot on Mandy,
you just hang on, and wait. Time will be a friend to
you, and I will. There, now, did you hear, Asahel?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hear anything, did you?” asked Caleb
of Asenath again with a shake.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Asenath, “it seems to me as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
though the hands are the hands of Esau, but that the voice
is the voice of Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Show! Well, now, Amanda, you and Asahel talk
now with each other. Here’s the tube.”</p>

<p>“Asahel Bow,” said Amanda, through the tube, “I
believe in you through and through.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” said Asahel, speaking outside of the tube.
“Amen whenever your mother shall say Amen, and never
until then. There is no need of any courting stick for
me.”</p>

<p>At this point of family history Caleb leaped around.</p>

<p>“I know what I did with it—I do now!”</p>

<p>“Did with what, Kalub?” asked Asenath.</p>

<p>“That letter for Asahel—it is right under my bandanna
in my hat!”</p>

<p>Caleb went to his hat and handed the lost letter to
Asahel.</p>

<p>The latter looked at it and said, “England!” He
read it with staring eyes and whitening face, and handed
it to Mrs. Short, who elevated her spectacles again.</p>

<p>“That old case in chancery is decided,” said he, “and
I am to get my father’s share of the confiscated property.
I may have yet to wait for it, though. My great-grandfather
was Bow of Bow. He was accused of resisting the
Act of Uniformity, and his property was withheld.”</p>

<p>Asenath lifted her brows.</p>

<p>“Bow of Bow,” she repeated. “He was a brave man,
I suppose. Resisted the Act of Uniformity? How much
did he leave?”</p>

<p>“An estate estimated at £20,000.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Heavens be praised!” said the suddenly impressible
Asenath. She added: “I always knew that you had good
blood in you, and was an honest man, Asahel, just like
your father; nobody could ever turn him from the right,
no more than you could the side of a house; no Act of
Uniformity could ever shape the course of old Seth Bow.
And you are a capable man, Asahel; your poor father
had limitations and circumstances to contend with, but
you are capable of doing all that he meant to do. I always
did think a deal of your father, and I think considerable
of your grandfather now. I always was just like a mother
to you, now wasn’t I, Asahel, good as two or more ordinary
stepmothers and the like?</p>

<p>“‘Bow of Bow,’ ‘Bow of Bow,’” continued Asenath.
“Well, I have prayed that Amanda might marry well,
and your part of £20,000 would be just about twenty
times the value of the Smith farm, as I see it. That farm
isn’t anything but a bush pastur’, anyhow.</p>

<p>“‘Bow of Bow,’ what a sort of grand sound that has!
‘Bow of Bow.’ I once had an uncle that was a stevedore,
an English stevedore, or a cavalier, or something of the
kind, but he didn’t leave any estate like Bow of Bow. I
think he uniformed in the time of the Uniformity.</p>

<p>“Asahel, you just put that there courtin’ stick up to
your ear once more and let me say a word, now that I
have new light and understand things better.”</p>

<p>Asahel obeyed. There came a response that could be
heard outside of the hollow tube: “Amen!” A murmurous
sound followed which was understood only by Asahel.
“You will overlook my imperfections now, won’t you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
Asahel? Pride is a deceitful thing, and it got the better
of me. I only meant well for Amandy, same as you do.
I’m sorry for what I said, Asahel. Marry Mandy, and
I’ll be a mother to you as I always have been. As good
as two common mothers, or more, same as I have always
been to Kalub.”</p>

<p>“And I am Asahel. Have my father’s intentions
been fulfilled in me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, elder,” said the Governor. “They have!”
shouted all. “That is a tale that makes me pray to become
all I can,” said a taverner from Boston.</p>

<p>“The purpose of life is growth,” said the Governor.
“Growth is revelation. Grow, grow, and past intentions
will be fulfilled in you.”</p>

<p>He crossed Lebanon green in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Lebanon, the place that had been filled with life, with
hasty orders to couriers, as “Fly!” “Haste!” was silent
now. What would be the next news to come by the green?</p>

<small>“CORNWALLIS IS TAKEN!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>These were thrilling days. The American armies
were marching south, and with them were advancing the
bugles of Auvergne.</p>

<p>Simple incidents, as well as incidents tragic and dramatic,
picture times and periods, and we relate some of the
family stories of General Knox of the artillery, who had
collected powder and directed, often with his own hands,
the siege-guns of the great events of the war.</p>

<p>When the French officers arrived in Philadelphia after
their journey from Lebanon, they were entertained at a
banquet by Chevalier de Luzerne, the ambassador from
the French court. Philadelphia was the seat of the American
Government then.</p>

<p>The banquet was a splendid one for those times, and
it had a lively spirit. The American guests must have
been filled with expectation.</p>

<p>For the plan to shut up Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown
was full of promise, and the military enterprises
to effect this were proceeding well. The lord himself was
dissatisfied with the plans he was compelled to pursue,
and any fortress is weak in which the heart of the commander
is not strong in the faith of success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>In the midst of the banquet, there was a summons
for silence. The Chevalier arose, his face beaming.</p>

<p>He looked into the eager faces and said:</p>

<p>“My friends, I have good news for you all.</p>

<p>“Thirty-three ships of the line, commanded by Monsieur
le Compte de Grasse, have arrived in the Chesapeake
Bay.”</p>

<p>A thrill ran through the assembly. The atmosphere
became electric, and amid the ardor of glowing expectation
the Chevalier added:</p>

<p>“And the ships have landed three thousand men, and
the men have opened communication with Lafayette.”</p>

<p>The guests leaped to their feet.</p>

<p>“Cornwallis is surrounded and doomed!” said they.</p>

<p>They grasped each other’s hands, and added:</p>

<p>“This is the end!”</p>

<p>The army, now confident of victory, marched toward
Yorktown, under the command of Washington.</p>

<p>The inhabitants along the way hailed it as it passed—women,
children. There were cheers from the doorsteps,
fences, and fields, from white and black, the farmer and
laborer. The towns uttered one shout, and blazed by
night. The land knew no common night, every one was
so filled and thrilled with joy. All flags were in air.</p>

<p>The morning of liberty was dawning, the sun was
coming, the people knew it by the advance rays. The
invader must soon depart.</p>

<p>“Cornwallis is doomed!” was the salutation from
place to place, from house to house.</p>

<p>General Washington, with Knox and members of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
staff, stopped one morning at a Pennsylvania farmhouse
for breakfast.</p>

<p>The meal was provided. The officers partook of it,
and ordered their horses, and were waiting for them when
the people of the place came into the house to pay their
respects to Washington. He stood in the simple room, tall
and commanding, with the stately Knox beside him.</p>

<p>“Make way,” said the people, “make way for age!”</p>

<p>An old man appeared, the patriarch of the place. He
entered the house without speaking a word. He looked
into the face of Washington and stood silent. There had
come to him the moment that he had hoped to see; the
desire and probably prayers of fading years had been
answered. The room became still.</p>

<p>The old man did not ask an introduction to the great
commander. He lifted his face upward and raised his
hands. Then he spoke, not to Washington and his generals,
but to God:</p>

<p>“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.”</p>

<p>The generals rode on toward Virginia, cheered by the
spirit of prophecy in the patriarch’s prayer.</p>

<p>It was a little episode, but the soul of destiny was
in it.</p>

<p>October, with its refreshing shade of coolness, its
harvest-fields and amber airs, was now at hand. Cornwallis
was surrounded at Yorktown. He had warned Sir
Henry Clinton, his superior, that this might be his fate.
He is lost who has lost his faith, and begins to make
the provision to say, “I told you so!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>Knox with his siege-guns, twenty-three in number, was
preparing for the final tempest of the war.</p>

<p>And against Yorktown were marching the heroes of
the old liberty banners of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i>.</p>

<p>In the early autumn of 1781 the field of war had
become the scene of a thrilling drama in the British camp.
Lord Cornwallis had taken his army into Yorktown, and
under the protection of the British fleet on the York River
had fortified his position by semicircular fortifications
which extended from river to river.</p>

<p>He must have felt his position impregnable at first,
with the advantage which the fleet would bring to him
in the wide river, until there came news to him that
unsettled his faith in his position. But he soon began
to lose confidence. He seemed to foreshadow his doom.</p>

<p>Yorktown was situated on a projecting bank of the
York River. The river was a mile wide, and deep. Lord
Cornwallis expected to have the place fortified by middle
fall, and that Sir Henry Clinton would join him there.</p>

<p>“I have no enemy now to contend against but Lafayette,”
he thought until the coming of the French fleet
was announced to him.</p>

<p>Washington determined to cut off Lord Cornwallis
from any retreat from Yorktown by land or by sea. His
plan was to pen up the British commander on the peninsula,
and there to end the war. He largely entrusted the
siege by land to young Lafayette. He probably felt a
pride in giving the young general the opportunity to end
the war. He liked to honor one who had so trusted his
heart, and whose service had so honored him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>Washington ordered the French army to the Virginia
peninsula, and with them went the grand regiment of
Gatinais, or Gatinois, with which many years before Rochambeau
had won his fame. The heroes of old Auvergne
were to be given the opportunity to fight for liberty here,
as they had done in the days of old.</p>

<p>These heroes had had their regimental name officially
taken away from them on being brought to America—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne
sans tache</i>. They desired to serve liberty under
this glorious name of noble memories again. They appealed
to Rochambeau for that distinction.</p>

<p>Their hearts beat high, for they were going to reenforce
Lafayette, who was born in Auvergne, and who had
desired their presence and inspiration.</p>

<p>So on sea and land a powerful force was gathering
to shut up Lord Cornwallis in Yorktown and to shatter
the British army on the banks of the York.</p>

<p>Washington himself was approaching Lafayette by
way of Philadelphia, Rochambeau by way of Chester and
Philadelphia, and De Grasse by the sea. General Thomas
Nelson, Governor of Virginia, was arousing the spirit of
Virginia again and calling out the militia.</p>

<p>At the great banquet which was given in Philadelphia
by the French minister, Chevalier de Luzerne, to Washington
and the French officers, when came the news that Count
De Grasse and Marquis St. Simon with 3,000 troops had
joined Lafayette, all Philadelphia had rung with cheers,
and the news thrilled the country. At that hour the destiny
of America was revealed. There could but one thing
happen at Yorktown now—Cornwallis must surrender.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
The General was certain to be blocked up in York
River.</p>

<p>Everything was going well. Washington and Rochambeau
went to Baltimore and found the city blazing
as with the assurance of victory. At this time, with victory
in view, Washington visited Mount Vernon, from
which he had been absent six anxious years. He passed
the evening there with Count Rochambeau, and they were
joined there by Chastellux. Washington now left his old
home for the field of final victory.</p>

<p>The great generals next faced Yorktown, with their
forces, some 16,000 men. They saw the helplessness of
Cornwallis, and as De Grasse wished to return soon to
the West Indies, the combined forces prepared to move
on the British fortifications at once. Seven redoubts and
six batteries faced the allies, with abatis, field-works, and
barricades of fallen trees.</p>

<p>The allies began to prepare for an immediate conflict.
They erected advancing earthworks, in a semicircle,
and with the French fleet in the bay, the 1st of October
heard the sound of the cannonade.</p>

<p>The peninsula thundered and smoked, and the drama
there begun was watched by Washington, Rochambeau,
Chastellux, and Count de Grasse. What men were these
with Lafayette at the front!</p>

<p>A great cannonade began on the 9th of October,
Washington himself putting the match to the first gun.</p>

<p>Governor Nelson of Virginia was in the field. His
house was there, too, within the enemy’s lines in Yorktown.
“Do you see yonder house?” said he to a commander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
of the artillery. It was the headquarters of the
enemy. “It is my house, but fire upon it.”</p>

<p>This recalls John Hancock’s message to Washington
at the beginning of the war. “Burn Boston, if need be,
and leave John Hancock a beggar.”</p>

<p>The enemy responded. The shells of each crossed
each other in the bright, smoky October air. The British
fired red-hot shot, and set on fire some of their own
shipping. The nights seemed full of meteors, as though
red armies were battling in the sky.</p>

<p>The 14th of October came—a day of heroes. That
day the redoubts were to be stormed.</p>

<p>Lafayette prepared his own men for the assault.</p>

<p>Then Baron de Viomenil led out the heroes of Gatinais.</p>

<p>Before this regiment De Rochambeau appeared to give
them their orders, which meant death. He had won, as
we have said, his own fame in Europe with these mountain
heroes. The attack to which he was to order them
now was to be made at night.</p>

<p>“My lads,” said he, “I have need of you this night,
and I hope that you will not forget that we have served
together in that brave regiment of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i>.”</p>

<p>A cheer went up in memory of old, followed by:</p>

<p>“Restore to us our name of ‘Auvergne sans tache’
and we will die.”</p>

<p>“That name shall be restored,” said Rochambeau.</p>

<p>They marched to death side by side with the bold regiment
of Lafayette, who was to lead the advance.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock the signal rockets for the attack
reddened the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>The regiment of Gatinais rushed forward. They
faced the hardest resistance of the siege. This redoubt
was powerfully garrisoned and fortified.</p>

<p>Baron de Viomenil led his heroes into the fire, and
his men fought like ancient heroes, to whom honor was
more than life. In the midst of the struggle an aide came
to him from Lafayette.</p>

<p>“I am in the redoubt,” said the message. “Where
are you?”</p>

<p>“I will be in <em>my</em> redoubt in five minutes.”</p>

<p>Strongly fortified as that redoubt was, it could not
withstand the men of Gatinais. They entered it with a
force that nothing could withstand, but <em>one third of them
fell</em>.</p>

<p>“Royal Auvergne,” said Rochambeau, “your survivors
shall have your own name again.”</p>

<p>He reported the action to the French King, and the
latter gave back to the heroes their regimental name of
old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne sans tache</i>.</p>

<p>These men are worthy of a monument under that noble
motto. We repeat, the words should be used on decorative
ensigns of the Sons of the Revolution; nothing nobler
in war ever saw the light.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yorktown fell on the morning of the 17th, and a
courier sped toward Philadelphia, crying, as he went:
“Cornwallis is taken!” Bells rang, people cheered.</p>

<p>The messenger reached Philadelphia at night—“Cornwallis
is taken!”</p>

<p>Windows opened. The citizens leaped from their beds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
The bells rang on, and the city blazed with lights, and
Congress gave way to transports of joy.</p>

<p>Dennis and Peter came riding back to the alarm-post,
shouting by the way, “Cornwallis is taken!”</p>

<p>The Governor knelt down in the war office, and the
people shouted without the silent place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Peter could afford to be magnanimous now to his
feeble old uncle. He hurried to the old man’s cabin and
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“I chop wood,” said a voice within.</p>

<p>“Uncle, it is Peter. Cornwallis has surrendered!”</p>

<p>The latch was lifted, and the wood-chopper appeared
as one withered and palsied.</p>

<p>“What is that you tell me? Cornwallis has surrendered?
What has become of the King?”</p>

<p>“The cause of the King is lost!”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see that I have anything more to live
for. Come in. I have nothing against you now, so far
as I am concerned, for <em>you came back</em>—don’t you remember
that on the night that I was to have been robbed you
came back? I have never forgotten that. You came
back.”</p>

<p>He tottered to the chest beside the table.</p>

<p>“Here, let me open the chest now while I have
strength to unlock the lid. The King! the King! How
he will feel when he hears the news! And he said of
young Trumbull, ‘I pity him.’ His heart will go down
like a sailor on the sea on a stormy night. Peter, I feel
for him. Don’t you pity him? Sit down by me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>He lifted the lid of the chest, and took out of the
chest a leather bag. He untied the bag-string, and turned
a pile of doubloons on the table.</p>

<p>“<em>One.</em> That is yours. You <em>came back</em> to your poor
old uncle on the night when the robber was trying to
find me.</p>

<p>“<em>Two.</em> It is yours, for you came back.</p>

<p>“<em>Three.</em> My sight is going. It is all yours, for you
came back.</p>

<p>“My hands grow numb, the world is going. I can
feel it going. But all that I leave is yours. My breath
grows cold. I have only time to say, ‘God save the King!’
I want to go, and leave what I have to you, Peter, for
you came back. Good-by, earth; I leave you my woodpile;
warm yourself by my fire when I am gone. God—save—the—King!”</p>

<p>He sat silent. Peter bent over him. The old man’s
breath was cold, and soon the last pulse beat.</p>

<p>Peter gathered up the gold. He would turn it into
education at Plainfield Academy and at Yale College.
Then he would go away, after Dennis, perhaps, to the
Western territory which would become a new Connecticut.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
